I got a guy kicked off a domestic flight today.
I was in a forward row as we were boarding for a 5 hour domestic flight. I noticed that the guy one row up and one over (so diagonally in front of me) took a picture of a pretty young woman whom I assumed was a family member or friend, but when she passed they didn’t acknowledge one another.  About a minute later he did it again with another young woman. I asked him “are you with her?” He ignored me but covered up his phone and turned so I couldn’t see. 

After the line of traffic to board slowed down I wrote a note to the flight attendants on the back of a vomit bag. I just wanted them to be aware. I handed it to one of them, she stood there and read my scrawly handwriting, said “thank you” and walked off. 

15 minutes later, an official looking woman came and asked me quietly if I was the one who wrote the note. I said yes and so she told the guy to come with her and bring his baggage. 

IDK what happened to him but we flew without him.
