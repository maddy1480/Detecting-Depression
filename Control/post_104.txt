Is styling baby hairs as an east Asian bad?
I can never get a straight answer on it as people seem to be really divided and uncomfortable with this issue. All of my friends who are mostly POC don’t have an issue with it but I’ve heard it is problematic from the internet. I’ve posted this on many forums and they keep getting removed which kind of further proves how controversial it is and how people don’t want to talk about it. I’m just genuinely curious though, I’m not trying to push an agenda or anything. I want to hear opinions and thoughts and educate myself.
