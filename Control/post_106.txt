In US do all colleges have a sports education teacher. I want to learn about what is the system there.

I needed some insight in something. Do Colleges have sports education teachers or do they not exist at college level.
Like a sports teacher who teaches both the theory of sports as well as the practical. Is it a thing or do colleges only have sports teams for football, rugby etc and a coach to guide them. Also how likely is it for the coaches to be females.
