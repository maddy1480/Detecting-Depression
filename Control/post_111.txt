I need to talk about this with somebody but nobody watches the exact same shows/movies I do
HUGE ASS SPOILER WARNING FOR JOHN WICK CHAPTER 4 AND THE LATEST SEASON OF SUCCESSION. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

I just wanted to post this somewhere because this has been the weirdest expierience watching both of these series. Basically none of my friends or people I know have seen succession AND the newest John Wick so I just wanted to post this here. 

I watched the original John Wick back in 2017, so naturally I bought a ticket to the newest one basically imidiatly. I watched it with friends on Friday night, and it was a masterpiece. 

Then, last night, after finishing up some homework I watched the newest episode of Succession. I remember distinctly thinking "huh, aren't wedding episodes like a season finale thing? Maybe they're dropping it in episode 3 because no one cares about Connor. And then I watched the episode and it shattered me into pieces. I have never seen a character death executed that way before.

So, I have been waiting all day to tell someone, I watched John Wick and Logan Roy die for the first time within 2 days of eachother. That was a hell of an experience.
