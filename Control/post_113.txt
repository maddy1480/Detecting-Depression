You know, I've noticed I'm the one who people keep around until someone better comes along!
(or something) and man it does a number to your mind and psyche. Never being anyone's priority, knowing of there's a fire and everyone has to paired togather to escape and no one will choose you first and even worse if it's an odd number.

It's also like if there are selection for any team member then they will choose their main people and see if there's any space to accommodate you or when no one talks to you to a point you've forgotten how to keep a conversation for more than a minute.

I just wish someone will choose me first like if there is a choice between $100 billion dollars and me, they don't even have to think twice before saying my name - someone who has the mentality of 'if something happens to her', I'll destroy everything.

It doesn't have to be violent at all, just in the poetic sense that they'll be destroyed without me.
