Realizing it's time to return home...
Hello! I'm just some average nobody, with a decent-paying corporate job, a STEM degree, in a major metro area. I do my job well, I get along with my coworkers, I get good performance reviews, and I occasionally get to hang out with some friends. I go to church on Sundays, and have no debt. Sounds great, right?

The thing is, I miss my family. I moved a \~400 miles away from a small town in the country (but not horribly small, \~60k people), and now I only get to see them about a half-dozen times a year. There's a lot of people back home I miss, and I just feel a bit... lost... in the "big city". My job is pretty stressful, and I think it's made me realize that after waking up day after day already stressed out, with no real support system here, what really matters in life - family. I'm also not a fan of the concrete jungle, I like the outdoors, riding ATVs, and generally not drowning in traffic everywhere I go. I really don't like living in a $1500, one-bedroom apartment. What I really want is a 2000sqft house, on an acre of land, with a workshop in the back. That's just not possible here, both by average tiny lot size and the insane cost of housing.

I've been looking at jobs back home, which is a bit harder than finding a job around here. My hometown doesn't have a large presence in my career field, but they do exist, and luckily I've been referred into a promising position. I've been told that they plan to interview me soon, after they fill another high-priority position first.

I think it goes against the norm these days to want to move closer to family rather than away, especially when that involves putting my career second. Realistically, I want to move somewhere with a lower cost of living, and generally just not be part of the rat race like I am now.

Anyone else get this feeling? Has anyone ever done this exact thing?
