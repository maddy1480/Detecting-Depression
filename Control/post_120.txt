I saved a puppy :)
I was recently taking a long walk maybe 20 ish minutes from my house and I was standing at a cross walk waiting for it to allow me to go but then I heard like a dog cry and I was confused, there was one of those ditches next to that road for like if there was a flood or somthing, and it has recently rained A LOT so I'm looking at it and I see like one of those turkey hill baggys floating in the water barley staying a surface but I noticed it was kinda inflated like it had a object in it.

So obviously I picked it up and brought it onto the side walk and opened it and it had a little doggo in it that looked like it was 2 months old like the size of a smaller chihuahua that looked like it was hanging on by a thread, so I called my mom and explained everything to her.

She came and picked me up and we took it to the vet to see if they could do anything. They couldn't really do much expect clean it's fur and stuff and check for ticks.


Afterwards we took it to our local pound.
Not sure where it is now but hopefully it's already found a owner and has a happy life :)
