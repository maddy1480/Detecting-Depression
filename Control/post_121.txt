Took a girl's phone number for the first time....but what now?
So I saw this cute girl at the train station a couple days ago. So, with all the confidence I could gather I walked up to her and asked her a question about the train schedule. From there we started talking and sat together in the train talking about us, what we do, interests and making small talk etc for a couple hours until we had to de-board. I asked her for her phone number when we parted ways.   


We have been texting since then in-between. She lives in a city 500 kms away and seems to come to my city a few times a year. But haha here's the problem, since she lives far away there's no way for me to ask her for a date. So, what do I do with this situation now ? :) I would love to get to know her better but Im afraid being so far apart, the texting will slowly stop.
