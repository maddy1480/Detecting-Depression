i read as a hobby, but i can't seem to get myself to read anything anymore and it's bumming me out
i started reading again at the end of 2021 and since then, I've read over 100 books. I've read about 3 so far this year, it's been a couple months since I picked anything up and I just can't seem to get myself to read anything. I've tried reading a couple different books and they're just not peaking my interest or anything. it's actually making me a bit sad because it's something I enjoy, and i can't for some reason rn??
