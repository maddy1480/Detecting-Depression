I am aware and embarrassed to know that I make everything about me
I have a tendency to subtly and almost unconsciously steer every conversation towards myself or make it about me. This behavior is not noticeable to others because I am able to conceal it effectively. However, I am conscious of it and aware when I am doing it. For example, when a group of people discusses a topic, the content shared is primarily objective. The participants do not draw attention to their opinions or past experiences unless it contributes to the conversation.  I struggle to read the room or gauge others' reactions before I speak. During a conversation, I tend to inject information about myself or my experiences that doesn't necessarily contribute to the topic or interest others. I later realize that I've drawn attention to myself for no good reason. Even though others may not notice, it creates a sense of disconnection on my part because my focus is on seeking the group's attention rather than engaging with the topic at hand. I don't intend to do this, and it's embarrassing when I realize it later. This has happened so frequently that I've become reluctant to talk to people and have reduced my socialization to only what is necessary at work.
