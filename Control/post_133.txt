What’s your favourite breed of dog, or do you prefer another species of pet?
Personally, I like Bichon Frisès, probably because I had one from birth up until I was eleven years old. I know it’s probably an FAQ but I really wanna know what people genuinely think of Bichon Frisès and also what their favourite breed is too.
