I watched Netflix’s “Challenger: The Final Flight” and I am amazed at how intelligent humans are.
The documentary explored the history of NASA’s space shuttle program, the accomplishments of the astronauts who died on Challenger, and what exactly happened on the day the shuttle exploded in 1986.

The Wrights’ airplane’s first flight was in 1903. About 60 years later, Yuri Gagarin became the first human to journey into outer space and orbited Earth. Shortly after that, the United States successfully landed two astronauts on the moon. NASA continued its work and launched the first shuttle mission in 1981. 

Yes, the documentary made me cry because it was sad. However, my mind was blown by how brilliant and intelligent our engineers and scientists were at NASA…back when iPhones were not invented yet. They figured things out without the aid of present-day technology. Those brilliant people at NASA sent astronauts to space and launched satellites with “old school” computers and machines.

I’m a millennial, and I hope that Gen Z and Gen Alpha will continue to advance mankind in science and technology. I know sometimes the future looks bleak, but I have faith that humans will continue to achieve great things.
