I wish I had more opportunity to help people
It may sound weird, but after I read someone's post about there always being someone around will g to carry their luggage up the subway steps and what-not it got me missing how I don't have a chance to share some kindness here or there.

I've been living and working on a farm for ages now, and as of late been super tired and really relying on grocery delivery apps and Amazon for my purchases. 

I just wanna hold the door for someone, or pay forward the drive thru , SOMETHING, lol.
