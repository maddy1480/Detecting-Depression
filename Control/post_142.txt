Plateau
Howdy! So I've been playing instruments (percussion and string) and actively in bands (different genres) for most of my life. I'm self taught and I practice regularly. I feel like I've been stuck at the skill level I'm at for years and have just hit a ceiling regardless of new techniques/tricks I try. Is this just as good as I can get or am I missing something?
