Hey all how does one learn more about Reddit and building communities here, have a friend who's a nurse who did a lot for everyone during lockdown then got sick herself, wanted to get her onto Reddit so she can chat to folks and help me build out our new community to make a difference to others. I'm a newbie also. Happy Easter folks, hope you got to spend some time with your loved ones.
