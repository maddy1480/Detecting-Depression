My friends say I am bad in all video games, but I am actually better.
As the title says. I actually play bad on purpose because 1. If I play too good they will lose interest and not play the game and 2. I actually find sweating in a video game to be repulsive, so I just do stuff like drive cars and try different plays.
Examples are Fortnite, Minecraft, and NBA 2K
