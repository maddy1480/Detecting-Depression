Am I too sensitive
I’m fairly easy going I feel or am I ,because recently the usual comments from some members of my family about how I live , the way I decorate my very small apartment, what I buy to make a small place look better , is getting to me. I don’t have a lot of money so when I got my small apartment I would buy and replace furniture etc when I had the money. And now after 3 years it’s looking so much better . But the negative comments keep coming . And I’m beginning to not want to have these ppl around. I’ve told them that I bought that item because I liked it and because it’s what I could afford. I’ve kept the colors in my home light ( different shades of white lol ). Why do ppl even care what I spend my hard earned money on as long if I’m happy ?
