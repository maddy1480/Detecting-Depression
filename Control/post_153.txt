I'm gonna try to make some friends at school
I go to an alternative school with a small group of people. I had a friend for the first half of the year, but he transfered out last semester. It's been a bit lonely, but everyone's still friendly with me. No one hates me or anything, I'm just autistic and not everyone can vibe with it. 

A few new people are transferring this quarter though, and I want to try and be friends with them! I'm not the best at talking to people, but I'm at least gonna try. Any advice?
