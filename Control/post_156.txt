The best thing about time... It changes.
Hey, I can't get this thought out of my mind, time changes so quickly. 

Exactly a year ago, I was preparing for the same paper I am preparing now. Was not in the best mental state then. Failed that paper twice but things are so different now from what they were 1 year ago, I have so many more achievements in my finances, dreams which I didn't even dare to see are true now feels unreal, I experienced romantic relationships for the first time no matter how short they were, made so many memories with my online friends had fun with them, even lost some close people, lost some opportunities, some regrets but still realising how much life can change in just a year is insane to me. 

Share some of your experiences too would love to read them. Also I am more positive and confident and in a better position for my papers this time. The only thing I want to change for next year is to have some new IRL friends, clear this exam and start working.       

Thank you for reading and don't worry, better times are ahead.
