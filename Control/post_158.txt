Is there already a drag queen superhero who uses two handbags as weapons in combination with martial arts that looks like voguing?
I don’t know much about drag culture or comic books but i just had this random vision of a superhero character beating up enemies with two big designer bags. All while doing high kicks in a vouge-like choreography. 

It’s not unusual that i have bizarre and funny ideas when I’m brainstorming stuff but surely this is something i have seen somewhere and it just popped in my head again?

This was a great Dall-E prompt btw.
