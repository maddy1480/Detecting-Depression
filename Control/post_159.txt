It’s a risk i am willing to take
Title’s a bit dramatic lol. I’ve been dealing with canker sore on my tongue for nearly a week now. The first few days were really tough as it was very painful to eat and drink. Today it’s feeling a little better, not healed yet but not the worst either. I really have the urge to have a drink or two as i feel like i haven’t gotten the most of the weekend. So i said fck it, it’s a risk i’m willing to take, then proceeded to order my alcohol and some spicy food for that extra kick. What’s worth risking for you today?
