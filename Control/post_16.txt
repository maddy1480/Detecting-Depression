Hey Redditors, do you have thoughts of wanting to work on your favorite show, movie, or medium? If so, what is it?
I've been active in trying to get my dream job behind the scenes in one of my favorite shows and so far I've been making an active effort. Do you guys ever have thoughts like this, and if you do, what is it?  


Is it achievable? I put myself out there. Should I let my passions known?
