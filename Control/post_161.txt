Can I start my career as a Lecturer at 33?
Now, I am figuring out life here. I have been an Online freelancer for over 7 years now. I managed to take my Masters in information technology but have not yet been employed. In short am still a freelancer as I am speaking. Due to my age I am worried and thinking of following a career I have been yearning for, that is to be an educator/ lecturer/ professor. Something in those corridors. At this age, is it too let? or this is something I can go for and still make it career-wise
