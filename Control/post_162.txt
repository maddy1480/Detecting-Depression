So happy to have found people like you on here…
I’ve been feeling very alone today, I’ve been feeling like nobody thinks the way I do, I work in an establishment that deals with a lot of interaction with the public and sometimes most people just seem to be so dull and I would never want to have a lasting connection or conversation with them. I’ve been thinking “Is this how most people are?” Stumbled upon this forum a little bit ago and I’m so happy there are fun interesting people like you who post about being excited about little things you’ve done for yourselves/others..or have similar thoughts and questions as myself and you respond with equally interesting comments or stories. I love to read it. You’re kind to each other and you’re sharing what its like being human and experiencing life as it is for you from your perception thank you for sharing it with others that’s all I wanted to say. Made me feel a lot better.
