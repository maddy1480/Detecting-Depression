What are some of your hobbies/extracurriculars/passions?
I've dabbled in a few different things. Most of the time, I try something new, become obsessed for a few months, and move on to the next hobby, then rediscover it a little later, and the cycle continues. I've done digital art, painting, knitting, writing, reading, online video games, swimming, winterguard, DND, crafts, and a couple of board games. I use to play chess religiously, before it was really popular in the younger generation. What else should I try? What are some of your hobbies?
