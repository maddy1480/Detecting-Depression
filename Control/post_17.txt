Why do people not tell you what they want?
So there’s a good chance I have ASD - My mum has it, so does my older brother. I always struggled in school and schools struggled with me but never bothered to test me although my mum requested it - so this could be why I’m struggling with this. But why don’t people just tell you what they want? 

2 examples that, I guess, have hurt my feelings, are:
- visiting a friend, and instead of them saying “hey when you come over, can you leave at this time” or “you can come over till about X O’clock as we have some things to do”, why do they start acting strange by not really talking to you or making comments about how much their house is a mess or how tired they are for you to leave? I can understand those conversations are awkward but idk if they’re not comfortable with me or if I’m over thinking it. Or is this just “the norm”
- please say they want to do something and then when you bring it up suddenly they’re making excuses to you? Like “oh hey I just got this new game. Want to play it later tonight?/we’re gonna play it tonight if you want to join?” And you agree, maybe get the game if you don’t already have it. But then you’re left sat there waiting for the person to respond or jump on but they don’t say anything about how they suddenly can’t play or got distracted later after you’ve been waiting for however long? 

I have always been a bit of a loner so maybe I didn’t learn certain social skills as a child. But I’m still quite young but old enough to have job and pay bills so idk, I guess I feel kinda stupid. Idk if I’m an over thinker or if this is just how people are. But I’d love to try and know why people do things like this or why people do it, and how I can make myself approachable for these kinds of conversations
