Are you able to spend the whole day in front of your computer/ phone?
I can't and I am always shocked when I see people playing for the whole day, then lurking facebook, then reddit, then youtube... 

I write books on my laptop, I watch TV series, I like using social media since I treat it as a good way of practicing my English and Spanish, I use Duolingo, I read news in the Internet.

I find my online time to be of a rather good quality but still I need to plan my day very carefully - force myself to go for a walk even if it rains, take a break to work out a little, just walk around the house and drink some water so my eyes can rest a little. 

Otherwise I'm just miserable. If I start my day looking at the screen, I'm just very tired and sick for the whole day. If I don't make breaks, I feel awful. 

What about you? Can you just spend several hours with your computer and still have the energy to live? Do you plan your breaks?
