Semi-Surprise Birthday Party
I’ve never really been big into birthdays as many in the past have either gone incredibly poorly or I was unfortunately made to feel small, so I didn’t host anything. My intention was just to go to work and get some extra money, as it falls on the Easter Holiday this year, but my plan was stopped short.

My boyfriend encouraged me to take the day off of work and upon asking why I learned that a good friend of mine contacted him earlier in the month asking to “conspire” (her words) on a semi-surprise party for me. 

(I say “semi-surprise” as they both knew they would have to let me clue in to get me to actually take the day off work)

I’ve never been genuinely excited for a birthday before, and even though I have no idea what they have planned for me I’m really just flattered that they care enough to go to these lengths!

I’m SO lucky to have these two in my life! :-)
