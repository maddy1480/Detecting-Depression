Awake at 3am messing around in my room. Discovered(what I consider to be) a serious problem.
So I'm a fresh high school graduate, and I have a few months of free time before I go to college.

Since I went to a boarding school, I didn't have a whole lot of free time to myself. Now I'm spending my nighttime free time reading random books and doing random things.

Tonight, I decided to look at myself in the mirror! Then I noticed something suprising, to me at least.

My hairline is receding! I'm barely 18! I find this to be a problem, because my hair grows VERY slowly. This means my hair isn't long enough to hide those bald spots!

This might not seem like a big problem, but to me it is! I've always wondered why my forehead looks huge from the side, and I never liked how it looks in pictures.

I did look at websites to see the kind of hairstyles for receding hairlines, but I want peoples' opinions. 

How do you deal with a receding hairline?

Do you have a go-to simple hairstyle for hiding it?

Does it bother you? (It bothers me a lot because I'm supposed to be young and this makes me look old, at least that's what others say)
