Excluding Reddit and YouTube, what is your favorite social media and/or which do you recommend?
I don’t do Facebook or Snapchat.

I’m trying to decide between IG and TikTok or maybe any underrated new socials.

TikTok:
I like it’s ability to show small random creators.
I like the strong visual/video aspect of it as well.
It feels more authentic.

IG:
Can do photo/screenshot stuff.
Most of my family and friends are on instagram.
(That’s all I can think of haha)

TikTok is owned by the Chinese though, in which there has been weird suspicion of it lately.
