Today someone told me they don't accept friend requests from males, and I both feel a bit weird and actually happy that I asked first
No I didn't send a friend request to someone random. We've a voice channel in a server where we study everyday and she's been here regularly for the past few days and we've talked quite a bit (just small talk). I usually don't send friend requests but I thought I'd casually ask her (via DM because I didn't wanna say that in the VC) that "hey, it's okay if I send a friend request. I don't usually send one, so I guess it's better to ask first" something like this. She politely asked if I was a boy or a girl (dunno why, because we cams everyday) and then said sorry I don't accept friend requests from males. This is actually the first time someone has said this to me... and I feel a bit weird because of this. But I also understand that it's her choice after all, and I'm happy that I at least asked her first if she's comfortable.
