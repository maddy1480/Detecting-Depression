What are your thoughts on the paranormal?
I’m pretty skeptic when it comes to paranormal claims, but I do like hearing about other people’s experiences. Lately I’ve been watching videos on the Mothman, strange happenings in Appalachia, and Skinwalkers. What do you all think? You believe abnormal things exist? Have you ever experienced something bizarre that you cannot easily explain?
