What's the most interesting conversation you've had with a stranger?
Hey everyone! I was just thinking about some of the most interesting conversations I've had with people I've never met before and it got me wondering, what's the most interesting conversation you've had with a stranger?

It could be someone you met on a plane, at a coffee shop, or even just in line at the grocery store. Maybe it was a deep and meaningful conversation that left a lasting impression on you, or maybe it was just a funny and lighthearted chat that brightened up your day.

Personally, one of the most interesting conversations I had was with a man I met on a train. We ended up talking about his experience living in a remote village in the Amazon rainforest and the challenges he faced there. It was fascinating to hear about a way of life that was so vastly different from my own.
