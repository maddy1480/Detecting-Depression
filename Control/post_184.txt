What did you do for someone you love today?
Today my husband just casually walks into my line at the store. Of course I was surprised to see him he bought an energy drink ; told me he loved me and handed it back to me. Then when I got in my car at lunch I found my favorite lunch in my driver's seat.

Think I'll keep him!
