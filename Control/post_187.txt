I forgot how to do long division
I remember doing it in 4th grade. Iâ€™m turning 30 this year. I just showed my mom my updated credit score and somehow it lead to us talking about math and division. She asked me to divide 32 by 8. Even wrote it out. I feel dumb as hell ðŸ˜‚  I used my fingers and still got it wrong omg lmao. I should probably enroll in a basic math course. At least I know how to write in cursive? ðŸ¥² 

My mom has the patience of a saint. Bless that woman.
