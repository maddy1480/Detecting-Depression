I watched a dog get reunited with their owner
I was at the vet a few days back and one of the best moments of the 6 hours I was there was watching a tiny white dog get reunited with his owner. It was special because this dog had been stolen almost 2 years ago, escaped, and survived around the same area where he was stolen. His name was Lightning Bolt and was very excited to his is mom after such a long time, despite having an injured leg he was jumping up and down.
