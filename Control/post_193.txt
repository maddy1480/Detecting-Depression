The Friday newspaper.
(apologies in advance for bad English)
I think I am one of the few people who were born in the 2000's and have a fond memory with something as old and boring as a newspaper. My father had a subscription to a newspaper called Al-Ahram "The pyramids", he was subscribed to a special edition called "The Friday Ahram" which comes with three papers, one for usual news but thicker since it's for the whole week, one for all the news about the cars in Egypt, and a small one with the edition's name. The last one wasn't really for news but for writers, poets and cartoonists. The last two were the ones which peaked my interest. The guy who delivered them would usually come at 9-10 A.M, my dad would take the papers and sit in the living room to read them. Then I would ask him to let me read the other two, he usually didn't mind. I would take them and start reading, the one about cars would get me bored really quickly, it was too analytic for 6-year-old me, I would quickly hop on the other one. It consisted of short stories, poems, and various cartoons that reflects on the life. But little me didn't understand it and didn't care, he was only there for the stories and cartoons that looked both exciting and funny. I would speedrun through the paper because I have to be prepared for Friday prayer. Sometimes I fail and I would be sitting impatient in the Masjid waiting for it to end so that I can return and continue reading. Then my dad had to travel abroad for work and took us with him, by the time we returned there was no point to get the subscription again since news is always available on the internet... I really miss that newspaper... Maybe I should get that edition for one last time.
