Why do you think dogs bark at people passing by early in the morning when it's quiet
Dogs scare the hell out of me!! And this fear has been there with me since my childhood. 
I see a dog and I take a U turn.. I am afraid to go out on a walk in the morning, coz I can hear them barking outside even when I am home
Why do they bark unnecessarily? Why??
