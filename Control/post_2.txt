It is my 10,000th day on earth today!
I came across an online calculator a while back and found out that my 10,000th day on earth is today!  It feels like the your 10,000th day should be a more significant day than your birthdays but nobody seems to celebrate it. Nobody else seemed to care except my girlfriend, and we had ourselves a special dinner today to celebrate!
