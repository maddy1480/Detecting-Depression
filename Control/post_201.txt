Officially feel old old today.
I was ordering Taco Bell today and started commenting about how 2 dollars for a taco is crazy. I remember back when they were 69 cents each back in the day.

Then I realized I sounded exactly like my dad when he complained about spending a couple of bucks for a Big Mac when he used to get them for well under a dollar. 

I'm officially feeling like I'm in the old club today. ðŸ«¤ Anyone else have a sudden realization like this?
