I’m going to give a girl a bouquet of flowers right now.
I was hanging out with my friend and I told her I thought her friend was cute. She said in all her years working in her restaurant no one has ever given anyone flowers, meaning this would be a unique gift. I’m nervous as hell but I’m going all in. I’ll let you all know how this goes!

EDIT:

It went amazing! I was nervous when I walked in so it was obvious right away lol. Her friend was a wingman to me and asked her if she could get my order at the table I sat in. When she came over I gave her the flowers and said I got her these because I thought she was really pretty. She giggled cause she saw my cheeks getting red and we exchanged numbers. I’m glad I gave her the flowers. She loved them and thought it was very cute.
