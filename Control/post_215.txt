Is ironic that many people say that they don't have time to play videogames but they watch TikTok everyday for 2 or 3 hours at night.
I would like that more people have the oportunity to experiment videogames because is another medium with his own language. I know that videogames are already a massive entertainment but they are nothing compared to movies, tv series or sports.

I ask to my friends why they don't play videogames, even already having pretty decents laptops and the aswer is always the same ''i don't have time to play videogames''.

All of us are busy with many things but is just a hobby, sometimes you can replace hang out with friends, the movie or the series that you want to watch, to play videogames instead. Is sad that many people are missing out a lot of experiences like Bioshock, Zelda Breath Of The Wild, Cyberpunk 2077, Gris, Skyrim, Life Is Strange and more... There's a genre for everyone.
