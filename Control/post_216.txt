What’s your view on food?
I like to tell people I eat with my feelings. Not in the ‘sad eating’ way but like I go out of my way to eat specifically something I feel like eating while trying to make it as healthy and/or as filling as possible. My boyfriend on the other hand is big on eating solely for sustenance. Never really eats because of cravings or whatever. Hbu???
