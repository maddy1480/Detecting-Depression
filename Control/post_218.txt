A guy that nobody thought would amount to anything proved me and several others wrong.
I used to go to school with a guy who really struggled. He was having to repeat several classes, and he was having to do a lot of night school to try to pass his classes. Some kids even used to joke that if we had a “Most likely to fail”, he would get that. 

He didn’t have a job as far as I knew, and in my mind at the time, I didn’t think he would be able to keep one. He was socially awkward. I’m not making fun of him. I’m just stating what I observed.

I recently saw him a few weeks ago. He was managing a Burger King. I asked him how he was doing and he said he’s been working a lot and just celebrated 10 years working at Burger King. 

I know most of us are probably thinking “well it’s just Burger King. Big deal!” But this is someone who nobody thought would amount to anything. While it may not be the best job ever, this guy who could barely pass algebra 1 was now in charge of that entire Burger King store.
