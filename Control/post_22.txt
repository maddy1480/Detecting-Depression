I just posted my first comment on Reddit and now I'm wondering if I should have just sat down and shut up...
I've been reading AITA for sometime, and I often think of responses to posts, but I have never actually repleied to anything, mostly because I've been online for a lot of years, and I kno how the Internet can go.

But...I kind of got caught up in this one. It's speaks to a subject I have quite strong feelings about - for personal reasons - and so I commented...aaaaand now my brain is kicking me in the head screaming: "WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR!!?? You know you'll get responses, and some people will take umbrage, and then you'll get annoyed and THEN! You'll be **straight** back down that rabbit hole you've successfully avoided for the last few years!"

So, I'm just putting this here, because talking to strangers on the Internet about talking strangers on the Internet is clearly the best way to deal with my foolish, impulsive behaviour.

I'm just going to make a cup of tea, and go and bang my head against the wall for a while...
