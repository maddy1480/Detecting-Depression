It's lovely that older shows are now subbed. This means my mother can now laugh at the same shows as I do.
Just found out recently that one of my favourite shows, The IT Crowd, now has Chinese subtitles on Netflix. So when my mum came to visit, we watched it together. She is fluent in English but she does often misses some of the jokes or sometimes they speak a little too quickly when it comes to watching TV or a film. We also watched The Grand Budapest Hotel and we both laughed so hard. I am so grateful my mum now gets the jokes I've been laughing at for years.
