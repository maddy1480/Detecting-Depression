Peacock has so much missed potential to be a good streaming service
For those who don't know, Peacock is a streaming service by Comcast that launched July 15th, 2020 and has 20 million subscribers as of writing this. From what I heard, it is kinda useless and that's kinda surprising since Comcast owns Universal and Universal is famous for its great movies. How did they mess up a streaming service about Universal?

If you search "Peacock movies" you can see movies like MEGAN and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, but it looks like those are the most notable movies on the platform (At least to me). I feel like they could have added classic movies Universal owns like Jurassic Park, Child's Play, and Fast & Furious to the platform.

As for new movies, well movies like Nope have been released to the platform 45 days after the theatrical release... Only to move to another platform like Amazon Prime after 4 months, and then move back to Peacock after ten months to be on it for 4 months again.

Overall, Comcast is missing the opportunity to make it known as "The Universal streaming service" by not putting its classic movies or even bad movies like Shark Tale which are being watched on Netflix a lot right now. I hope they realize this in the future because it could up there with Disney+ and HBOMax as one of the top streaming services.
