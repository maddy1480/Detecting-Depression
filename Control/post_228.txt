I genuinely miss my old stuffie
He was a stuffed plushie of lambchop which I gave the creative name of “Sheepie”. I had him (I know lambchop is a girl but I always referred to Sheepie as a he so I will be calling her a he) since I was two. Over the years of love and dragging him with me everywhere, he was re-stuffed and stitched so many times that I eventually just had to get rid of him because he was constantly falling apart.

I decided to bury him in the backyard, since I couldn’t bring myself to just toss him out. I still sleep with a stuffed animal, a plushie of the pokemon oshawott, who I love very much, but on many nights my heart still aches to have Sheepie back. I miss him so much and all the memories I have with him are so dear to me :(
