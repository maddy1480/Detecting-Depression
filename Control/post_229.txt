I am happy.
I have a job I like that's fulfilling and pays well. I cook in an assisted living facility. Everyone loves my cooking. The residents are all sitting down eating, the head nurse is walking around munching on one of the rolls I made and one of the caregivers just finished scarfing down a slice of the cake I made.  One of my coworkers keeps trying to mess with me and I seem to have perfected the art of not giving a fuck.


I'll be headed home soon. My husband promised me a foot massage and there's a bottle of my favorite wine in the fridge. There's  a lot wrong in the world, and a lot of problems in my own life, but in this moment I am happy and I will do everything I can to hold onto that feeling.
