Marvel’s Guardians of The Galaxy is a great game, and I think about it quite often.
Last February, I bought the game on a whim, not really knowing much of anything about it, only that people thought the Avenger’s game was below par and that fans might think GOTG was too. I’m happy to report that it was a great decision and that I was completely blown away by it—so much so that I think about it every so often. 

GOTG is one of those games that you are happy that modern rendering technology is as good as it is because anything less would be a disservice to how absolutely beautiful it is! Every new area makes you take a moment to really absorb the detail, and the game has an open world feel, even though it isn’t. It captures the grandeur of space *and* the franchise, and makes a **huge** emphasis on scale— an area where *many* games in the past have had an issue with. 

While it is strategy focused, it’s not incredibly difficult, which made it relaxing to play. The enemies are larger than life and vary so wildly that the game always felt fresh and new. The story was captivating and made me want to continue playing to discover more and had twists and turns that only enhanced the gameplay and drive to “complete the mission.”

I only wish that I could afford to buy an item from the Collector’s Emporium, and upon completion of the game I could fly to different worlds and play freely. 

Excellent game, excellent execution and well worth the money I spent on it.
