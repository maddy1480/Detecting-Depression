Someone I met on reddit thought I was a cat fisher and it was honestly the biggest confidence booster
Last night I was on my local r4r and I messaged someone who had an interesting post up. We got to talking and realized we had a lot in common, one of those things being tattoos. 

She asked to see a pic of mine which I was happy to show off. Bear in mind, I have a full piece on my chest so I had to be shirtless. A few minutes went by without a response and then - 

“There’s no way that’s you lol send me your real pics” (and a bunch of other equally positive things)

Took me a second but I immediately had the biggest smile on my face. I assured her it was me and I could verify however she wanted. She gave me her snap and we’re meeting this weekend!

Y’all, it was such a compliment to be thought of as faking pics but that’s just your actual body, I can’t even fully describe it. Definitely the biggest ego booster I’ve had in a very long time.
