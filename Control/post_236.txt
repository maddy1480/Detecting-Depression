How do you ever get over being bullied in school
Its been a long time since I(20f) left school but suddenly last few days I have been getting flashbacks to the time I was bullied at school and every time I think about how much I endured I start tearing up. Which is strange because last 3 years I barely cared to remember any of this but rn it has been affecting me alot. Worst thing was I was bullied by the kids for no reason and the teachers too were very harsh and rude when I did bad on my exams. I was always left out from everything and unfortunately I never had the courage to voice out for myself to anyone. I wish I could erase these memories from my brain
