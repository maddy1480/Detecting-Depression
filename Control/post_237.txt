What's a movie or TV show you can watch/read over and over again without getting bored
Random thought while getting a midnight snack lol, humor me please.   


We all have that one movie, or TV show that we can't seem to get enough of. It's the one we keep going back to when we need a pick-me-up, or when we just want to relax and unwind.   
Is it a movie you loved since childhood or a TV show you can laugh to even if you already know what happens next. Curious what it is **and what exactly do you like about it?**   


Mine would definitely be Modern Family for TV Shows, as for movies, maybe The Hobbit Series (I've rewatched all of it more than 3x already)
