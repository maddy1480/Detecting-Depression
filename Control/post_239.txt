Sand dunes on my legs
There’s this trend going online where people are finally being body positive and comparing their body to natural things, like skin to waves, body hair to forests etc. 
I remembered an incident similar to this. When I was a teen, just growing up, gaining weight, the sweet time when I didn’t have any insecurities I had this conversation with my mom. I saw her legs and said “oh! You don’t have sand dunes on your legs??” And my mom had a visible doubt on her face. Then I showed her my thighs and said “see I have sand dunes on my legs!” 
Later, eventually I realised over the years that those are strech marks. But now that I remember of that time, I just feel proud of the the young me for embracing the so called “flaws” in the most beautiful way possible.
