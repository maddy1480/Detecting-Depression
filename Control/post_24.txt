It's funny how our perception of historical facts can change according to our country's media production -especially non-english ones-, and how things that are obvious for certain people absolutely aren't for others
Let me preface this by saying I know it's obvious for a lot of people lol

I was watching a TikTok about historical facts, and in the comment a girls said that she never thought about Cleopatra and Caesar being alive in the same time period. It make me think about how, as a French person, it was always obvious to me, mainly because of the french comic *AstÃ©rix et Obelix*. Several were adapted in movies/cartoons, and one of the most popular was (and still is by the way) "AstÃ©rix et Obelix mission Cleopatra", in which we see Cleopatra and Caser interacting a lot >!they even kiss at the end!!<. So it's a pretty well known fact for french people (and maybe for people from French speaking country), because even if we learn it in school, it's also the plot of a very very popular film (which is sometime easier to remember than lessons lol)

I always knew the media we consume change the way we see things, but idk, reading this girl's comment made it more real in a way. So now I'm wondering what is considered obvious historical facts in other countries, particularly related to movie, TV shows, books, etc., that other people may not find that OBVIOUS, or maybe don't even know

Feel free to correct my english if you want, as I am not a native speaker :)
