I’m obsessed with mixing drinks, but I don’t want to drink alcohol
Hey guys. I’m a 19 year old college student in the U.S. and I’ve been really, really interested in mixology lately.

Before I go on, I am not of legal drinking age, and I have not ever had alcohol nor do I intend to…probably. I’ve been thinking about how interesting the drink combinations seem and suddenly turning 21 doesn’t seem so bad. At the same time, though, I dunno.

I just find the concept of mixing interesting. Coffee and tea, to an extent, but spirits are really where it feels like you have room to play with flavor. I’ve never been good with cooking, as much as I enjoy watching Babish on YouTube, but the idea of crafting flavor on a plate or in a glass is very fascinating to me. I just don’t know how I can step into that area if I don’t have any interest in the alcohol itself. My family is pretty against it and the last relative I had to tempt fate needed a liver transplant to survive, so I’m pretty sure I won’t be touching the stuff. It just seems a shame that an area so deep and full of potential is inaccessible if you don’t want the buzz. What do you guys think?

I know that there’s “zero-proof” stuff and mocktails and such, but based on my research a good amount of it just seems like a juicy sugar bomb rather than a complex flavor to enjoy, and while those can be fun it’s not really what I’m after.

Do any of you out there feel similarly? Were you able to scratch that itch with making different coffees or teas? I haven’t met anyone similar but I know you guys must be out there somewhere!
