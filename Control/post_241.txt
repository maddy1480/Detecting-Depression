I need friends
I am an introvert and I don't talk to a lot of people but still, I made a few good friends in college. We all used to be together and have fun but for a few months, everyone is hating each other resulting in a very toxic environment. It is so toxic that I don't even want to stay in college with these people, but there is no option, we all live in the same hostel. 

The only good friend I have lives in a different state, so talking to her is also very difficult due to different schedules.

All I need now is peace and some true friends who understand you and support you and not like the toxic friends circle in which I am.
