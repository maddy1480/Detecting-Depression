I have a phobia of lunch boxes
I’m not scared of lunch boxes, but I just don’t like them. I can’t have a food that comes out of them no matter how nice it is. I gag whenever I have food that comes out of them (or I know that food came out of one) or I smell them. It has to be some childhood thing but I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this.
