It's scary how fast the transition is from teenager to "adult"
I put adult in quotes, because while its technically 18. Most people wouldn't call an 18 year old an adult. I'm talking more like early 20s.

I turn 21 in the next week, and its just crazy to think about. It doesn't really feel like i've reached this age. It just kinda feels bizarre. 3 years ago I was just graduating high school, then covid and college. And now i'm 21. It feels insanely fast.

And I know age is just a number. No one is saying you have to change or be a certain way just cause your 21 or 30 or 50 years old. But it's easy to see how society kinda stresses you out. Cause at this age, your starting to look for employment. People are kinda pass the immature teen stage. Start worrying way more about relationships. It feels harder to make friends. You put some pressure on yourself that you have to start being more of an "adult". Back in high school, I was kinda shy, worked on self improvement. But wasn't too worried, cause I was just a teenager. Now i feel like I have to get my shit together.

Idk. i mean tbh I don't think anyone really changes THAT much in a few years. Hell in their life even. But it feels very weird to be in this position right now. Kinda fully leaving the comfort of childhood for real this time.
