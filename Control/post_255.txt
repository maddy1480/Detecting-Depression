I visited America for the first time and really enjoyed myself
I went to New York and it was really cool, the whole time I felt like I was the main character in an American movie. The food was really great. And the people in New York have a reputation for being rude but everyone I talked to was actually pretty nice, especially when they found out I was a foreigner. It was just overall so different from what I was used to, it was uncomfortable at times but itâ€™s just part of the fun I guess.
