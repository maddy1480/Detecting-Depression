I turn 32 on the 10th and I literally have no one to celebrate with .
I got my girls 5yr & 1yr old but I just don't have any friends to celebrate with . Is that what happens as you get older ? What happened to all the friends I made in college and my adult life ? How did I end up with no friends ? I'm a good person , at least I feel like I am ..
