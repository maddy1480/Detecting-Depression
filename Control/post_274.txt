My 2 year old daughter made me so proud today
She always does tho, she’s amazing.

Now, for the last 35 years, ever since I was born, my 1 constant in life is Super Mario. I’ve played practically every game, when a new game comes out, I play it. The oldest stuff I have from my childhood is Mario related.

Well, this morning I was watching her, we played with her toys some before daycare and then she wanted to watch tv. I put on the firestick, and she kept yelling what I thought was “Bananas” but close to “Mynana”. So I put on Bananas in Pajamas. She got upset. I picked her up, took her to the TV, and she pointed to the Super Mario Bros Supershow. “Mynana” was actually “Mario”. We have never let her watch that before. I had no idea she knew who Mario was.

So i put it on, she started dancing to the Mario Bros Supershow rap at the beginning, when the show came on she sat there laughing and giggling and asking question. She called Toad “Baby”, Luigi is “Weegee” and Princess Toadstool/Peach is “Let it go” after Frozen.

On the drive to daycare, which is like 5 mins, she just wanted to listen to Mario. So I put the themesong to the show on and played it through my car speakers. She’s giggling and loving it.

I think this week I’m gonna bust out my Super Mario comic from Nintendo Power and read a few to her.

It’s amazing to watch your children get into something you love.
