I got accepted into my dream university today!
The interview was on Monday where they said it would probably take a month until I get an answer from them but I got it today, only three days after! I am so happy right now and glad that I didn't have to wait for a whole month, because now there is no need to overthink the possibility of a rejection anymore.
