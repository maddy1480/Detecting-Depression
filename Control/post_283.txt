Persian is such a funny language

Like we wanna tell u that ur cute so we say moosh bokhoradet While it literally means 'A Mouse Should Eat You' 
Or i love u so much and i wanna express my feelings so I'm gonna tell u jeegaretō bokhoram 
And it means i will eat your liver  [ Don't  be afraid, we are not cannibals😂lol ]
