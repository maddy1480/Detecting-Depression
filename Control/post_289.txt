They come in three
Growing up I was always told good things come in three followed by three bad things (not always). I was given three good things yesterday ( approved for a rental, a pay raise at work & got a vendor spot for my home baking business ) in the last hour I was hit by a train of horrible things -  my utilities bill cleared now I’m -$250 , A Dorito stabbed the top of my mouth so hard I bled for a bit, finally I fell over my dog and BROKE MY FINGER  and gashed my knee. I’m honestly taken back with how much has happened in the last hour and feel like I’ve paid my dues for a good month.
