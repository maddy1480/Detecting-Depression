Authentic westerns
I watch a lot of western movies, I've almost ran out of good ones. Any suggestions would be appreciated. 
I see what I consider a flaw in all westerns. After the bad guy is shot, what happens to his guns, saddle and horse. In the westerns I've watched, you never see anybody capitalize on the booty left behind. On some of the shootouts, a resourceful man could start a horse ranch with all the horses left behind.
