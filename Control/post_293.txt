I cut someone off today in traffic
I feel so bad. I was making a right turn onto the street and there was a lot of traffic. The light turned green for a while and then I saw a car that was slow so I thought they were letting me in. However, they were not and I feel so stupid and bad and guilty. My day is entirely ruined I think they even had to swerve out of the way.How do I become a better driver?
