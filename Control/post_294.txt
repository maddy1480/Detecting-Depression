Is it rude to use a beauty filter on other people in a group photo?
So in advance, I'm venting here because I know this isn't a REAL problem. But I'm annoyed at this other girl and there is no profit in calling her out, so I'm just complaining and hoping for a second opinion. 

Today I went shopping with my bestie and her friend from out of town. We were just hanging out, looking at clothes and chatting. Wonderful lil lowkey afternoon just us girls. At the end her friend asked permission to take a group photo, so we huddled up to take a dumb little group selfie. The friend asked if it was okay to post it to socials, which it totally was because we have other mutual friends. No big deal. 

But when I check my phone a few hours later, girl put a beauty filter on all of us. I know the three of us don't have that clear of skin, weren't wearing a full face of makeup or have eyes that wide. She added me to tag, so I looked at her other photos for the first time and seems like she does this to her photos, even solo. Which, is like her choice, none of my business, I think they look fake af and nothing like she does irl. She is still pretty, just... Come on, we were just hanging out at target. None of us dressed up. 

I'm kinda annoyed at how fake I look. Some of our mutual friends haven't seen me in years and I don't really like that they might picture me fake like that. I struggled with self esteem and feeling pretty all my life. But I finally do! I like who I see in the mirror these days, and using a beauty filter just makes me look.... Cheap, desperate and insecure. I wish she had only done herself if that was her vibe. But it's very much not mine.

It's fine, not a big deal, I won't see her again probably for years but we will talk online for sure. No reason to start drama over something I know is petty. I gave OK to post, not to "touch me up" and post. 

It's just rude, y'know? Am I crazy y'all?
