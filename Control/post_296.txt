Help me pick a mask!
I play the drums and want to record some covers but i don't want to show my face (i had very bad acne and so I'm embarrassed of how scarred my face was left)so i decided I'd use a mask or a helmet. Also it'd be  great to do it as a tribute to Daft Punk (my favorite music artists)  and many because I like many characters with helmets or masks (Genji, Master Chief, Doomguy, etc) 
What might be a cool mask to wear or do you know an artist that makes some cool ones?
