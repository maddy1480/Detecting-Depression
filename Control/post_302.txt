Karma is Psychological
When the concept of karma is discussed, I often hear it thought of in a holistic sense. I see karma as more of a subconscious psychological effect. like deep down we all know the bad shit we did and end up â€˜punishingâ€™ ourselves with self destructive behaviour. you can only delude yourself so far. likewise, with good deeds, our self-image improves and leads to healthier happier lives.

perhaps. what do yal think? ðŸ’›
