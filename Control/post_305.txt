this is bothering me I might not go to my favourite cafe
I have been going to this fancy cafe, where sometimes I order a coffee only which is $1.50 to just hang out to the place.. And it's also kinda fancy cafe where a sandwich cost around $10. 

And when you ask for your bill usually the server, gives you a notebook with flap with the receipt on it and put my payment and leave my tip on that notebook. Is it normal to do that even though its just a $1.50 payment?  Or you could just pay at the till and say "keep the change"? Because I saw someone pay at the till and he's bill is 10x higher than mine but he never gave a tip.. This is in the East Asia
