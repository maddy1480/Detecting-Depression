I'm the youngest but I feel like the older sibling
I'm a narcissist. I feel like I had to be because of how obvious my parents were about their double standard. Mostly my mom. My dad was around but barely (working or just not physically present). They babied my sister. They knew they spoiled her and now it's backfiring. She knows nothing about anything and I feel happy tbh seeing her be scared. I want to help her tho because I hate how weak she is. I'm a narcissist because I saw everything they did for her and i never had an ounce of that. I'm a narcissist because I tell myself I'm better than my sister. She wouldn't know what to do if she lived my life. If she felt how lonely it was or how I had to learn everything by myself because I had no one to rely on, she'd probably kill herself. But I hate feeling this way because I love my family so much. This is how I rationalize it for myself tho. I went through this because I was the only one in this family who could go through this. I don't thank them tho. I thank myself.
