Do you hate taking selfies of yourself and did you improve?
As the title suggests, I find it extremely difficult to take selfies in the moment! I usually need to be really feeling myself for one lol.

I do have some confidence issues but I've come a really long way these last 2 years. I still find myself so not photogenic though, which kinda sucks in the visual era of social media.

I've been on dating apps and have my best pics on display. Unpopular opinion, but it has been an absolute great experience for me confidence-wise. However, there's always someone who's like, "send a selfie of yourself now," which catches me off-guard cuz I need to mentally prepare myself to take a half-decent pic. I even do video calls to confirm I'm real over sudden selfies lol.

So my question is: what are your thoughts on how to fix this? For people who overcame this, what did you do? I'd really like to take some pics when I'm young cuz I can look back on them later on.

Thanks very much!
