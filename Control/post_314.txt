Glad I’m home
I (female) think I just escaped a weird situation. I was walking home on my street in the dark and there was this man walking in front of me who turned around, noticed me, stopped and stepped into the half shade of a closed garage door seemingly waiting for me (just two doors before my house entrance). I changed the side of the street and typed on my phone waiting for him to walk away but he stood there watching and grinning. Luckily I could reach my friend on the phone and the guy walked a few meters stopping again right next to my house entrance staring at me. I had to walk past him and remembered reading about talking loudly to predators. So I asked him why he was just standing there in the dark and he said he was trying to roll a cigarette and asked if he could help (I said no, he asked if I was sure) and what my name was. I yelled no, fumbled my keys from my bag and ran inside. I’m still shaking.
