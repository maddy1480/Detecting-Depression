Would you leave your shirt?
So I left my shirt hanging outside and... I fell asleep. While I was dozing off, it started to rain and hasn't stopped since. So now the shirt is still outside while I debate to myself if I should take it out and dry it indoors (we don't have a clothes dryer) or just let the rain work it's magic like a natural hour-long washing machine.

What would you do if you were in my shirt?
