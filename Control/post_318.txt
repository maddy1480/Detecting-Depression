Ramen is better than pho
I’m saying this as a Vietnamese person, so you know I’m not joking around. I have had some of the best pho in Vietnam. I’ve also had some of the best ramen in Japan, and let me tell you, I definitely prefer ramen over pho.

Ramen just has so much more variety. Yes, I know you can have beef pho, chicken pho, or seafood pho, but the broth for the most part is the same. The difference is the meat. 

I love any food that’s packed full of flavor, and that’s what you get with tonkotsu and miso ramen, among others. A rich hearty broth. I don’t get that with pho. It’s a much lighter broth. When I was in Vietnam, I had pho every other day and enjoyed every second of it. Still, if I had a choice, I wouldn’t hesitate to choose ramen over pho.
