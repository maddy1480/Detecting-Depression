Playing piano in a music shop and feeling ok
I have a love hate relationship with music, cause for a big part of my life I played violin without chosing It, but because my family pushed me to do It. Though I would like to compose and experiment with electronic, I don't really do It cause parte of me don't think it's fair using knowledge I ended up having without really chosing to study It. Same with piano (learned a bit in conservatory while I studied violin) which for some reason I don't feel at ease playing when someone is home. 
Anyway, here I am in a music shop trying to play music from one of my favourite artists, and I'm feeling good. But I know that when someone I know Is with me, I would feel something like embarassment/trying to deny my music capacities. Even tho, maybe for some unconscious need of approval, I would play something in front of them.
Just wanted to write that.
