I made a stupid mistake at work and feel like an idiot. Can't shake it off. what's a mistake you've done at work that took you a while to shake off?
I was told to NOT talk to clients that have attorneys. a client requested to speak with me and I figured it was ok because they requested it, so I proceeded. Turns out I still wasn't supposed to speak to them. Boss was upset but gave me a break because I'm new. I still feel like an idiot, especially because there's  no way of telling what the  repercussions will be. I'm worried although my boss says not to be. 

any big mistakes you've made at work, but still got a pass?
