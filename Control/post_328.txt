My friend takes shower for 1 hour everyday at my house
Help!!!

I have a friend who came over to my shared house to stay for probably 1-2 weeks. She doesn't need to pay extra rent as house owner doesn't mind to let her stay for short period with me. Everything was ok but she takes shower for 1-1.5 hour everyday in the bathroom, which affects other people and they complained. I told her many times but she said I'm overreacting and she got angry with me.

Is it normal or I'm just overreacting?

Thanks in advance.
