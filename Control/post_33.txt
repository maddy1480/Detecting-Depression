I got accepted to grad school for creative writing . I'm 52 years old. I'm really excited to be a college student again!
I've completed my first novel. The editor just finished with it. Hopefully, I can publish this summer. Looking forward to becoming a better writer!

Edit: Just got an email saying I've been offered a graduate assistant position and a $10k scholarship! I can't believe it!!!!
