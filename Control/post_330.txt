What will you do on your days off?
For me, days off are important in that they give me the opportunity to focus on my own needs and joys. Whether it's relaxing, pursuing personal interests or sharing time with family and friends, these activities leave me feeling fulfilled, balanced and happy. Rest days are important re-charging moments for me, bringing renewed energy and motivation for the next energizing work week.
