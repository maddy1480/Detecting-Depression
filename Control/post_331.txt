Noodles are so fantastic
Someone once told me that people are either bread, noodle, or rice people. 

I can’t imagine being any version of myself where I am not obsessed with all forms of noodles. Udon, ramen, ALL PASTAS. The silkiness, the flavor, the satisfying slurp as you reach the end of the noodle. It just can’t get better than that.

Does anyone feel this way about a certain type of carb? Or is it just me?
