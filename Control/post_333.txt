Fear
I just realized that I always have that stranger feeling. For as if you had to suddenly start sharing a room /bed with someone you work with or anyone outside your comfort zone (family ) I always feel that way I know it's because I grew up in a physically/emotionally abusive household which lead to foster care. I was also bullied. I have been happily married for four years now, but still can't get rid of this feeling of fear.
