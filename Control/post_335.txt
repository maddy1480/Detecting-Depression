Hello there! So, it's my birthday tomorrow but today I want to spend some time hearing about you!
Everyone around here makes a big deal out of birthdays, I'm not fully into the celebration side but I enjoy it anyway since its an excuse to interact & have fun with people.

What I enjoy most though, is the calm reflection that comes before & after. While I enjoy the experience overall, I feel there's also a lot of selfishness in it, so before that I want to hear from any of you here... Anyone at all is welcome!

What are you celebrating recently? Any achievements you'd like to announce? Or any sorrows you'd like to offload?

I'd love to hear from you, celebrate with you & be there for you.
