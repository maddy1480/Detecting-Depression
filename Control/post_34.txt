What is the last gacha game you played before you dropped gacha as a whole?
For me : >!Alchemy Stars and Limbus Company!<

Both of them have the same problem : More frustrating, less fun.

>!First AS, Match 3, quite new concept. It was okay at first until it becomes a big brain strat that tested my patience and IQ. And I got burnt out of it months later. Not to mention the required need for certain characters.!<

>!And then LC, I have many vents :  Since there are only maximum and minimum coin flips, even good matchups average 75% odds of winning clashes. Nothing is more frustrating than flipping tails twelve times in a row. And Since after it's release, it's a anger hell, due to the fact the RNG is almost like If DARKEST Dungeon + Slay the spire have a child ( in the worst way possible ). and please prepare for the amount of info dump like ALOT. !<

And let's just say after I left, some of my group members call me having a skill issue or JUST READ ... like okay, then you really want me to get frustrated again?
