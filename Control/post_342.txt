What do you do on your days off?
I’ve been going through a quarter life crisis. I’ve been stuck on autopilot mode for the last 12 months with my jobs. Besides the taking care of the home. I could literally just sit in my room and  stare at the wall and the day is literally gone. I’ve got no spark or inspiration. No hobbies to turn to. 

I need some help. What do you do on your days off?

Someone please inspire me!
