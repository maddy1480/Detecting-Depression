Kids and colorful hair
I have my hair dyed in a vibrant shade of blue, and it seems like the kids find it amusing! Back in my country, a little girl came to talk to me and asked if I was a mermaid, or maybe *gasp!* a WINTER FAIRY! She then asked me if I can change my hair color as i please. I said yeah, but it takes a while, and that cute little penguin mumbles "just as I thought!!!". Now that I'm living in a different country a little neighbor got her eyes shining wide and i could understand the words "mom" and "blue!!!!!!!", and it was honestly adorable! I love those interactions and the innocence of the kids when facing something different.

So, fellas with colorful hair or alt style, tell me, what was the best line you heard from a kid?
