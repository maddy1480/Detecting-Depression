Waterworks
I just watched Guardians of the Galaxy in the theater and I could not hold back my tears. I was sobbing uncontrollably for some of the scenes. You know the kind when youâ€™re trying to hold it but couldnâ€™t so it came out even worse than you wanted it too. Granted, Iâ€™m super generous with my tears and am known for crying in most emotional movies. You name it, I probably did cry watching it. But there was really something about the seeing those helpless creatures that just broke me. 

Does anyone experience the same thing and have any advice on how to hold back the tears? Because itâ€™s caused me some very awkward situations (like crying when my coworker said sheâ€™s getting a divorce when I donâ€™t even know the dude and that was the first time I heard sheâ€™s talking about her personal life? ðŸ˜”)
