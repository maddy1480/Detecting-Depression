Almost died today, wheel flew off my car on the highway
I guess I almost got someone killed too? I’m lucky nothing happened after I skid to a stop 100 yards down the road on the frame of my car. How does this happen? I regularly have my car looked at, at least every 3-4 months. But there is a reason this happened and I’m partly to blame, and who knows what else is! The shop says someone tried to kill me by sabotage, lol, which as crazy as it sounds, idk. Maybe.

But I doubt it. The reason it got to this point is because when I had that inspection done a month ago, they told me my warped brake rotor was safe (as have 2 other mechanics). Light vibration on the car and that was it, still safe. However, this led to me being negligent. In the past 24 a new vibration started occurring, on and off. Sometimes a bit worse, sometimes back to normal. When it got bad this morning however, I called the mechanic to bring it in. I decided to drive it there instead of tow it. Nearly a fatal mistake. 

The light vibrating I was used to was now a jarring vibration, however it still would go back to ‘normal’, wasn’t constant. That’s why I thought I could make it to the mechanic. After getting on the freeway, I probably drove 5 or 6 miles before it flew off like it evaporated. My car started sliding and I held the wheel still as I could and lightly braked while pulling onto the shoulder. I am very lucky no one was hurt. And yes, the shop is adamant that someone has sabotaged me in a murder plot.
