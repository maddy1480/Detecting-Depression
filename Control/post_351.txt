I used to tape my favorite songs on the radio and listen to them over and over again, and so now when I hear them I expect to hear a specific glitch or interruption that was in the original recording
I was reminded of this today while listening to The Cure's "Boys Don't Cry" because I ran out of tape in the final seconds of the song back in high school, so in my head it always ends abruptly during a particular note.  My friend in high school (now wife lol) gave me a tape of Roxy Music's "Avalon" album, which got eaten by the tape player and I had to carefully splice it back together, so "More Than This" always skips a beat in my internal replay of the song.
