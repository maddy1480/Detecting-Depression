Idk what stupid dance i did at work
If you’re like me who dances when happy, you’ll get what I mean. Earlier at the office, I walked past my lead. I greeted them and they nonchalantly congratulated me. I was surprised and confused, and they were as well by my reaction. Apparently they didn’t mean to spoil that I got promoted. Anyway, i fkn danced when I heard it. Idk what stupid dance I did but I danced the shit out of me lmfao. Good fkn day.
