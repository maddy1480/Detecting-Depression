Applied to Meat Cutter Academy
After displaying that I can bust my ass off at work I've managed to get management's approval and recommendation to begin the process of being trained as a meat cutter! Never did I think life would lead me here but then again I never expected to live past 25 when I was a teenager. So here's to the future and whatever else it may bring, cheers 🍻!
