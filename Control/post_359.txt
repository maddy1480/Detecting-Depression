How good is a weekday off though?
Lately, I have realised how great days off are when you wake up without a hangover. For years, if i knew I was off The next day, I'm straight on the beers.

Today, I woke up leisurely, had a couple of coffees in bed and I've still got the whole day ahead of me to get shit done and I feel great!
