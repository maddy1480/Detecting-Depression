Free at last
I just finished my college project and it feels like I passed the biggest kidney stone. I came back home, slept compensating for the caffeine fueled all nighter, now I woke up and it all feels like a bad dream. I'm so happy I'm done.

I'm thinking I should celebrate by burning the report in a big fire. Other suggestions welcome.
