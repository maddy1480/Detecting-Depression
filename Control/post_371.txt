I think society will realize over time that most generations are more similar than different.
I saw an Instagram post, the one that has the sentimental music from Donkey Kong Country (Aquatic Ambience) and the title said it was for 90s babys. But the comments were filled with people saying they were born in the 80s, 90s and 2000s and that they recognized everything in the video. It made me think about how similarly we all experienced childhood and that we are all probably more alike than we are different.
