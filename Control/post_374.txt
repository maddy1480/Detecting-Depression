What way do you draw your O’s?
Husband and I are back at it again with another question. I write constantly and recently I’ve noticed I draw my O’s left to right, counterclockwise. I have a vague memory of being told you’re meant to draw them right to left, clockwise. 

Are they any clockwise O folks here? How do you write your letters?
