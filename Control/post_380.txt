I used a microwave for the first time today!
I know it sounds outrageous, but I've never used a microwave before. I don't come from a third world country or from a poor family. We weren't rich or anything, but we had enough to get a microwave for sure. 

For some reason we never ended up buying one for my entire life. We have a regular oven for baking, and we heat up food directly on the stove. Even after I moved out, I never got a microwave just because I never really needed one. I grew up without one, and it never seemed necessary. 

Today I wanted to heat up my coffee at work, so I finally tried out the office microwave. I've only heard horror stories about overheated water and exploding eggs and metal in microwaves, so you can see why I was a bit apprehensive at first. But everything went off smoothly and I have now finally used a microwave to heat something up. I know it's a silly thing to be excited about, but for some reason I now want to go and heat up other stuff just to try the thing out.
