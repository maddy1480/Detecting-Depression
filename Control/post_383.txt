When I was a kid I used to bite my fingers when eating McDonald’s french fries.
And scream my head off. Like, every time. It had to do with the way I ate them. And, for some reason, I just wouldn’t seem to learn.

My parents thought it was the funniest thing in the world because I always wanted mcdonalds french fries. So they would just get them for me. And hilarity would ensue.  

Btw, I’m 40 now and finally learned not to do this.
