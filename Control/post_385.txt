Do you feel stuck at where you are in life but also realize you have the capability to change at any time?
I am acutely aware I am the biggest obstacle in my own life, but I still feel stuck. Not wanting to make a wrong decision has paralyzed me into making no decisions and just zombie walking through life. Anyone else feel the same?
