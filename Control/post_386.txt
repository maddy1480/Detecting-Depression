Not sure where to find time for me on my 25th birthday
My 25th birthday is coming up in about a month and I’m starting to get a lot anxiety about it. I don’t have a lot of friends and no friends I would plan anything with for an event like this, but do have family close and my boyfriend. I think I’m getting anxious not knowing where I can find time to celebrate myself. We have some family friends coming into town and my mom and them have decided we’re all going to our city’s music festival…which may sound fun, but I’ve been in years past and it is not exactly my scene. That is the day before my birthday. 

The day of my birthday we are doing a wine tour with other family friends of my parents. It’s their sons girlfriend who’s turning 21 and planned this tour. We have the same birthday, so she invited our family along. I’m happy to go and I know it’s selfish, but it just feels like there’s not anything specific for me this year. I do have a wonderful boyfriend who has said he’s got me some gifts. I feel a bit uncomfortable asking him to take me to dinner, but I think me planning for us two to go somewhere I enjoy after the wine tour will be nice. 

I don’t know. Just needed to get that out in the open I think. I don’t want to feel sorry for myself, I just have spent a lot of time in the shadows with friends and my family. My birthday is the one day a year I get to be the center of attention. Which is fine, I don’t really want to be any other day lol. But I do enjoy being in the spotlight the one day a year I guess. Does anyone have any ideas for ways to do something special for myself with limited time available over that weekend?
