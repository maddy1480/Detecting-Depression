travelling vs one place life: could man choose one?
Settling down in one place, having a steady job, life commitments to fulfill, makes me feel like I'm "losing something".Traveling to different places, without having fixed commitments to fulfill, but rather, a short-term schedule, makes me feel like I'm "missing something".Either way, whether I've managed to create a stable routine for 'settling in one place' or 'traveling to different places', it always makes me miss one or the other.The question is why man wants/needs to travel, discover new things, but also wants/needs to settle down in one place, have a pre-established routine? How can man solve this, if we can call it a problem?
