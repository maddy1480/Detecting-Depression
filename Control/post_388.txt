My friendâ€™s toddler looks and sounds creepy when they laugh.
Am I a bad person for thinking this? Itâ€™s everything , the sounds and the facial expressions.

Some babies are cute when theyâ€™re laughing but this one seems like itâ€™s possessed. Part of me feels guilty for thinking this way but in general, itâ€™s just not a cute baby.ðŸ«¢
