First time using Uber!
Kinda bonkers- and not terribly exciting- however, for me it was a blast. 

I flew into a smaller airport and my destination was about 7 minutes from the airport terminal. Before I left my home airport, I download the Uber app.

When I arrived at my destination airport, I stopped and bought a beverage and sticker (I'm a sticker whore!) and walked to the RideShare area. Did all the app stuff to make it work and "hailed" a ride.

I successfully flagged down the right vehicle and was treated to a dynamically engaging conversation with the driver who came to the city/state I was in as a refugee from Somalia 19 years ago. Before I knew it, I was at my location and we talked a few moments longer before he had to roll onto his next pickup.

I've been *in* Rideshare vehicles before, however, my normal travel partner does all that black-magik trickery and I just enjoy the ride(s).

It was an efficient and rewarding first-time experience!
