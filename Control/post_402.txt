Advice needed!
I'm (22 F) moving home soon to a whole new city and I'm really excited. But I'm also wondering if anyone has any advice on getting involved in the community when you're just moved? I want to get involved and meet new people, make new friends, but I'm not sure how. This is my first time moving to a proper place of my own. Please help!
