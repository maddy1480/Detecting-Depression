Does anyone else occasionally get a strong desire to just lie on the ground in the pouring rain?
Not in an existential crisis kind of way, I just think it feels so nice. Itâ€™s not even raining right now but boy I wish it was because I would absolutely be lying in my yard just enjoying the feeling of the rain on my skin.
