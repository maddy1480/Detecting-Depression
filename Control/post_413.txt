Do good people ever get ahead?
It just seems to me that being a good person can suck. I try to live my life with a general sense of moral and goodness, yet always catch the bad breaks. I can never seem to be the one who catches any breaks or luck. I watch others do all kinds of wrong and not have a care in the world yet I work hard and love my family and still end up with the short end of the stick alot.
