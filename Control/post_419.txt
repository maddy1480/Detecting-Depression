I drove to work today!
OK, guys, you probably don't fully get it. Today, as the forty-something mom of two, this is the second week now I am behind the wheel all by myself! So, it's as far outside rush hour as it could be, and the road is rehearsed carefully before under the supervision of the husband, and most probably I'm making a ton of mistakes still (did I manage to look in the rear-view mirror before turning? totally not sure about this), and also the bollards are SCARY jumping at me out of nowhere like little shits they are, and the parking is even worth, but - I'm getting there, little by little. Now, tell me, what are you pursuing right now, what would be your current challenge?
