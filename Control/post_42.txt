Regrets
YL:DR moved myself and my wife away from our hometown and friends, and now I regret it but can’t see a way to fix it. 

I’m not one to normally feel regret for my life choices, they made me who I am today, both good and bad. But lately, within the last year and a half or two years, I’ve found myself regretting moving away from the vast majority of my, and my wife’s, friends. 

We had spent a majority of our lives with much the same group of people, and I left for college while she stayed local. When I finished and graduated, I took a job in the same state, but 2hrs away, and then eventually moved us both out to WV, both for work and so we could buy a house of our own. I never cared at this point that we were 2+ hours from all our friends, it’s an easy drive. But lately I’m regretting it. 

Whenever we go home to visit with friends, be it holidays or just because, we both feel a little “left out” because we aren’t able to keep up with what is happening in their lives the same way we used to. It’s just sad, and makes me want to move back closer to “home”, even though it’s not possible right now, and won’t be for at least two more years. 

Anything y’all regret, and how did(or are) you working to get past/reconcile/fix it?
