My neurodivergent brother uses AI to have more heartfelt conversations with my mom
He can be pretty dry and especially in text can have a very hard time carrying on a conversation. My brother just got out of pretty crappy 5 year relationship where his partner isolated him from my mom. He’s been trying to be more communicative both with myself and my mom. I have an easier time communicating with him because I meet him where he’s at. My mom’s had multiple brain surgeries so she has her own issues. She often feels hurt that he isn’t an emotive conversationalist. 

He told me he’s been using ChatGpt to have better conversations with our mom. 

It’s freaking amazing. My mom has even mentioned that my brother’s been more expressive recently and she’s so happy. I will never tell her. In my opinion the program is just helping him in understanding how to better communicate his own feeling.
