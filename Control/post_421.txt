Cooked brussel sprouts and the odor might kill us
I've never had brussel sprouts before, so my husband pan-seared some in avocado oil for me.  They were great, but now our little house smells like death. We're laughing so hard because it's baaad!! 

I've cranked up our Febreze plug-ins, opened the door, and sprayed my VS body spray twice now. 

Anything else I can do?

We're gonna be that weird smelling family at graduation tomorrow. ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†
