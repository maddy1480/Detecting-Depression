asdfghjkl was a terrible password, even for an eight year-old
I stopped doing it **long ago**, but I still remember thinking that was a good password for my Gmail and a bunch of other services (because of course I also reused it).

Nowadays Google won’t even let you use it as a password, which is good as I’d wager it would be cracked within days

PS: if that’s your password for any non-disposable accounts, now is a great time to change it!
