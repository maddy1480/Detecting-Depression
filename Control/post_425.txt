I don't like getting gifts
My birthday is coming up and when I get questions that allude to a gift someone is intending to get me, it makes me feel uncomfortable. Personally, I'd rather spend time with people and make memories. I think gift giving feels like it's obligatory or as a symbol of caring about someone but really it seems capitalistic. I don't want or need gifts. I'm content with what I have. Even in my daily life I don't feel a need to buy unnecessary things. That's just me though. It's not to put people down who like giving or receiving gifts or people who enjoy stuff. It's frustrating that I live far from the people I want to spend time and celebrate with. :/
