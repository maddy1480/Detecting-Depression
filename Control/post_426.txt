Felt bad for my actions and made amends
Earlier this week, the grocery store was particularly crowded. An employee was in charge of directing traffic to the different check out lanes. While he got involved in a lengthy conversation with a customer, people started getting confused about what to do and began cutting the rather long line of customers waiting to check out. Other things bothering me at the moment, I snapped and told the employee to pay attention to the lines. Although the other customers in line with me seemed to be happy I said something, I knew immediately the tone of my voice was rude and inappropriate and very unlike me.  

I went back to the store later with a substantial gift card and an apology for the employee. He seemed to brush it off as not being a big deal and part of the job, though when I handed him the card, I could tell the fact that I took the time to man up to my mistake meant something to him, and then he said as much. I got the impression that one action might have turned a really crappy day (I played my part in that) into a good day for him.

I guess the point of my story is you can't always fix everything you do wrong, but you can at least try and make it as good as possible.
