I’m in a small indie rock band and last night was had our biggest gig yet
One of the band member’s family works with an organization that hosted an event in our local municipality that had around ~500 people, and they were looking for local acts. Before, we had only played in front of a maximum of 30 people, so this was a big deal to us. I’m just proud of myself and the band for doing this.
