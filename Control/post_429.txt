I turned 25 two days ago, what's some advice you would give your 25 year-old self to live a fulfilling life?
I think the title says it all. For context, I was kind of a high achiever but it stopped 4 years ago. I'm trying to be more productive again and also to simply live a more interesting life! 
Thanks to everyone who might take some time to answer my question ðŸ˜„
