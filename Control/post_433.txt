Goldmember is one of the funniest movies I've seen this year.
I had an edible and two drinks and for some reason the fact that Doctor Evil gets his sharks with lazer beams attached to their heads and they immediately shoot someone is the funniest thing to me right now. Obviously it isn't nearly as funny when I'm sober but I am thoroughly enjoying myself right now.
