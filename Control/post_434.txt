My cat escaped about 48 hours ago and hasn't come back. Please send positive energy to get Jimothy back home. Thanks!
Yes his name is Jimothy. My daughter named him from a one off joke from the Office. We adopted him 2 years ago and they are best friends. Hell, he is my best friend too. He's the best cat I've ever had! Please will him a safe return. We love him so much and are heartbroken. He's never been outside in his life and I live around a LOT of feral strays. Please send all your love and energy so we kind find our best friend. Thank you so much!!
