Road rage
I feel so guilty for riding this guys a** yesterday. He had no break lights and we kept stopping because of construction.. 
I started thinking about my issues that day and I started to get more pissed off so I sadly took it out on this poor guy. I was mad cause he didnâ€™t have his lights which was so stupid of me cause truly he wasnâ€™t a problem lol.. obviously.
I was going to say sorry cause he stopped at the light and rolled his window down but I didnâ€™t end up doing it so then he flipped me off when the light turned green and I did it back. 
I feel so bad and just wish I said sorry to this stranger. I knew I was in the wrong..
(I suck at typing my bad) 

Does anybody else feel guilty when they have road rage? ðŸ˜…
