Well, I'm officially old
I knew it was coming but didn't think it would happen so fast. I'm 24, been getting gray hair for 2 years now and just the other night at work I threw my back out just stepping off a ladder. It still hurts. It's a painful realization that I can't just power through things like I used to. I'm now mindful of what I'm doing and my body position and all kinds of other things I would have never thought once about a few years ago. Hell I'm even looking at chiropractors and starting a stretching routine when I wake up. It only gets worse from here doesn't it?
