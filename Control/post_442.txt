Just walked out a film club screening
It was my first time joining the film club at the cinema since I moved to this city. For various reasons I just couldn’t get into the film or connect with people around me. It was an Iranian film.

I mustered the courage to just walk out and I’m so glad I did as I think there was another 30 mins to go. 

Have you ever walked out of something early?
