I'm writing a sci-fi/horror book and i'm looking for some creative suggestions for some specific, complex mental/behavioral effects that a unique fungi causes, can I get your help?
TL;DR - I'm writing a sci-fi/horror book and need a fungi to cause a town to go crazy with a lovecraftian type of pschological disorder that doesn't really exist, but is intriguiing and complex (like truman show disorder or mass dance hysteria)

The basic synopsis of my book is about a crew of underwater cave divers who are attempting the worlds deepest subfreezing salt water cave dive in the world. A tunnel that starts and ends in 2 different mountainous lakes. the tunnel is effectively a massive "V" shape that was thought to have been created by unique volcanic gas emmisions...... long story short, there's one pocket of air that contains a unique microbial bioluminescent fungi (little did they know the fungi isn't quite from our planet but rather from a volcanic moon of Jupiter. The fungi gets accidentally attacched to one of the crew members... and the story is about a specific city they go back to that gets affected by this fungi. It causes some extremely bizarre mental and behavioral problems.

What I need help with is figuring out some engaging effects this fungi can have. I'm thinking along the same vein as that one town who had a mass-dancing craze where people couldn't stop dancing erratically til they passed out. Or even better something like when you wake up one day and the people in your house feel like imposters and kidnapped or kiilled the original loved one. Something to this effect. A unique and engaging specific 1-3 fictional symptoms of this extraterrestial fungi.
