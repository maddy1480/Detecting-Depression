For people living in a 1 bedroom apartment, where is your computer & desk?
So I'm about to start a WFH job and I'm so pumped about it. It's very much a corporate office job, lots of Teams meetings & spreadsheets and whatnot, but it's super flexible and I get benefits! I'll earn enough to move into a bigger place next year, but for now I have to make do with working & living in a tiny apartment.

My question is, for people in a similar living space, how to you divide up the space? Is your desk close to a window? Far away from one? Towards the front of back of your place? Currently my desk is towards the back of room cause I feel like people can hear me talking right next to the window lol, but I wonder if that's even an issue or not.
