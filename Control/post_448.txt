Intellectual topics (and people) are a tad bit overrated
Some people brag how they are intellectuals and how they have complex conversations, how they hang out with the cream of our society.  
  
But, to be honest, isn't there beauty in simple, everyday conversations? Why always dissect and ponder about things. Sometimes I go to a pub and chat up a tired construction worker, or an honest farmer with dirty boots. The working fellows (I find) tend to be much more cunning with their delivery of jokes and stories, as this is what they shorten their times with during long labour hours.  
  
For example, there is this old man who used to be a grave digger and everybody fears to shake his hand because his grip is so incredible. Not even the lumberjacks dare to give him a hand when coming in for a beer after a long time. I find it very entertaining, some repeating how he nearly broke their entire hands during a handshake.
