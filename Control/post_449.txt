Someone in the bar yesterday told me they loved my hair and I can't stop thinking about it!!
So to give a background, I am a 25F who just moved to a different country for grad school. I have curly hair which I realized much much later after putting my hair through a lot (smoothening, straightening, keratin treatment, what not). Since a year or so, I have just been growing my natural hair out and using some shampoos that work for my hair and creams that help me keep my hair curly for a couple of days after washing them. Throughout my life, I never saw myself as conventionally attractive. I am a little chubby, had some acne when in college etc. When I was a teenager my self confidence had taken a huge hit when everyone around me were dating but I just never felt pretty. 

But slowly, as I grew up I worked on myself and started focusing my energy on building my career, better relationships with people around me. I am doing a graduate degree from one of the top schools in this country, I am in a relationship with an amazing person who loves and adores me, I have been taking care of my mental health and physical health. 

Yesterday me and my friends were out in a bar, just enjoying when someone (\~40F) came up to me and said "Girlll I love your hair! You look so pretty with these curls". Though I acted all cool, said thanks, chatted for a bit, there was a part of me that couldn't stop thinking about it. In my home country, it is not very common to speak to strangers or even give random compliments so I have never had a stranger say something like that to me before. It honestly made my day! I wish I could go back and talk to the 17 year old me who felt sad that she was not as pretty as others around her. Little things like these really do matter huh
