I love experiencing sleep paralysis. Do you?
Might be messed up to be saying this but I genuinely do love it. Although I've only experienced it two times, I wouldn't say no if I was asked if I would want to have one again. 

It sounds cheesy in my mind but I like the instant fear and panic I feel when I see those monsters just appearing in my sight right after comfortably finding a good position to sleep in. Maybe because it's something I usually don't experience and the familiarity I have with it at the same time.

My previous dream started when I was just imagining a normal random girl and her suddenly morphing into this scary lady that was really close to my face and just stays there. I close my eyes trying to run for help (which obviously doesn't work) but once I do open my eyes she's still all up on my face. Everytime I see her, fear just takes over my body. Went on for like 2 minutes. I got out of it by entering a lucid dream.

I also love it because it's my passageway to lucid dreaming because it's so easy for me to recognize sleep paralysis. Share your experience!
