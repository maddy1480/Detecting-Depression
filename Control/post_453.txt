anyone wanna play "2 truth 1 lie" for a "purchased on wish" pilot study?
Hey yall, hope you're doing great. I'm conducting an experiment for one of my courses, it studies lie detecting abilities. We still haven't met any participants but I'm bored in class so I thought why not do a bootleg test run for the lies we're gonna use lol. Class isn't super interesting rn I honestly don't even know why I set in it when I go back home and study the thing on my own anyways but oh well thats besided the point. Point is, wanna play a few rounds of 2 truth 1 lie with me?
