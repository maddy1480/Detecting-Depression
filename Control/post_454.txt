My wife and I recently went on a trip and were able to pet a different dog every day, purely by chance.
Day 1 - random volunteers at airport with two beautiful golden retrievers wearing "pet me" vests.  Don't mind if we do! 

Day 2 - quaint little gift shop in old town. Shop owner had their giant mastiff Beauregard there.  10/10 - would pet again.  

Day 3 - went to see my niece for the first time in years.  Didn't even know she had a dog, but met & pet Millie. When she came out the first time I looked at my wife and just said "IT'S HAPPENING!"

Day 4 - it was getting toward the afternoon and I'm not gonna lie - doubt was starting to creep in.  We stopped at a tiny store in the woods to get ice and drinks and were just about to the door to leave when the clerk's dog came out from around the counter. Pleased to meet you,  Zeke! 

Day 5 - picked up our own dogs from the sitter's house and have not stopped petting them since.  

This trip involved seeing a LOT of family, many of whom are emotionally taxing to be around. Pretty sure the universe sent these puppers to us to help get us through, and it worked!
