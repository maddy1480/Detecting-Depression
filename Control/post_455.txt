Dealing with a lack of closure
As an adult in my mid 20’s, I’ve had so many temporary people and relationships(non-romantic) over the past few years. The thing that bothers me the most is that things will be going only good and then out of the blue they stop talking and cut all connection with me. I can understand if it was preceded by a nasty fight/argument. However, nothing of that sort happens. It’s completely out of the blue with no effort to have a conversation and talk things out.

I know I’m not owed anything. It just sucks that it keeps happening multiple times over the years. And it doesn’t hurt any lesser than it did the previous time. How do you deal with the pain of it and move ahead, without knowing why they decided to end things with you?
