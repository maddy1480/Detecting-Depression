Do you ever just do random stuff, just to try it out? What's the most "not-you" thing that you've ever tried and enjoyed?
I saw an ad for acting classes. I'm not actor. I never felt the need or the drive. 

Part of me wants to try it, though.

It's kind of how I ended up playing an instrument. I'd dreamed of doing it, but never saw the point as it never directly helped my career... and now I'd never go back. I'm grateful that just decided "eh, whatever" one day and did it.
