Weird faint buzzing/thumping sound going on 24/7 in my apartment
Hello, sorry if I posted in the wrong group. 

I have a weird sound in my apartment and my best guess is that there is an issue with my hot water heating circulator pump or some sort of electrical motor system in my apartment. The sound is like a continuous small thumping/buzzing repeatedly thumping. It sounds like if my neighbors are doing laundry 24/7 faintly. (But they are obviously not). 

So some strange things I've noticed about this sound. Not sure if it is a coincidence.

One the day I first moved in, I didn't hear this sound. On the second day, I started hearing this sound and it just continues forever. Then I went on a 2 week vacation. I came back home and on the first day back, I didn't hear this sound. On the second day I start hearing this sound again and still ongoing since then. (My fridge is always on so I do not think that is the culprit, and I haven't used the heater or ac yet so I don't think it's that either.)

Please help me out so I can sleep peacefully. I will let the landlord know once I know the source of this.

Thanks!
