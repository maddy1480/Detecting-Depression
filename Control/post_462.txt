First post, discussion on "realism" in movies/films
Hey y'all this is my first post on reddit as a whole, tried making other posts on other subs but that failed due to my lack of karma so kinda hoping some casual conversation here could build it up.

Anyways, I was curious what is y'all interpretation of "realism"? 

I never understood this trope as most popular movies in cinema like fast and furious saga or marvel movies for instance aren't necessarily realistic but do have characters that we can relate to in some ways or tackle issues that mirror our own world in some way.

Like what is your personal definition of realism?   how does it affect the movies u watch?   if a movie isn't grounded in reality like say - Spiderman no way home is an action/superhero movie... so do u still like/dislike the movie?

Also could u give me upvotes? trying to build some karma as this is just my first post in reddit.

Hope y'all have a nice day and thanks for upvotes!
