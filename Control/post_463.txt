silence is defeaning
hello there. i am 26f and i just needed a place to share and vent out how lonely life could really get and it does not help how difficult it is to make adult relationships may that be platonic or romantic and it gets kinda tiring now. 

do you have any advices on how could i navigate this weird phase of my life? how do you converse/connect with people without being so awkward and stiff?

idk how to make friends in real life so im just shooting my shot here in the internet i guess. i hope u are all doing well :)
