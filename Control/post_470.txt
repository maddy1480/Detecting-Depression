Just wanted to say thank you so much for the birthday wishes!
Title says it all. For all the people that sent me birthday wishes on Friday(my last post) means alot to me honestly.

I do want to say though that I just find it quite weird now that the birthday just comes and goes and it’s just so strange how people who thought would wish you a happy birthday don’t. For example, none of the people who I talk to at college said happy birthday to me. The only people who said it to me (apart from my family) is a person who I was talking to at a Nike store after he recognised me and my managers and a few of my collegaues.. It honestly just feels heartbreaking and it’s just a weird feeling. I do sometimes miss getting a bunch of birthday greetings but ever since I got older, seems the less people I hear from now.

I don’t know man, it’s late at night and I’m just in bed writing whatevers on my mind. Hard to keep going at times honestly.

Hope you are having a great day.
