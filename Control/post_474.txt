My favorite artist released a new album and it totally put a 180 on my bad week.
it's everything I wanted and more from them, I love how their sound progressed, lyrically it's straight poetry and resonates deeply with me. Might just be a honeymoon period type moment but it may actually be my favorite album of all time.

I love music's healing properties. <3 Not necessarily because you forget your problems, but because it gives you an outlet to release any pent up emotions.

Does anyone else have a new release you're vibing with?
