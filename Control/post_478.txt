Does she like me or I'm just needy?
So, I've been going to this tiny shop every week close to my home for about 2 years.

The last 3 weeks as been crazy!

There is a really HOT and CUTE girl working there now and guess what?

For the last couple of weeks, she has been looking at me. I've been there 3 times since she is working there and each time she have shown me a couple of signs that she could potentially be interested.

For example:

One day they were very busy, and there is one queue for 2 tills. When I was close to go to either one or the other till where she was, the guy called me to go to his till and while I was walking she was looking at me kinda sad.

Another day she was kinda far giving ice creams for the kids and she was looking at me and I was like 5m away.

And now today I went to her till. She was alone and while I was walking to the till there was like the most intensive 3 seconds eye contact ever and we completely didn't talk to each other.

Another if she likes me or if it's me fantasising or being needy. What would you do in my situation? I tend to overthink a lot. And I ask myself if I'm just needy or if she does that with every boy. I can't stop thinking about her but is she thinking about me? Please I would like to know your opinions.
