Is it gossiping If Im talking about someone doing something illegal or morally reprehensible?
The lines between gossiping, venting and talking about someone are pretty thin... Recently I got wind that a friend of mine has engaged in some either illegal or, If not, very ethically questionable activities.

Now, I dont want to be a gossip but I feel like is something of importance enough to some people that I should talk about it to them, so, what is really the line between gossiping or talking about what someone has said or done?
