Revamping the COVID exposure app.
I was thinking about this several days ago when I got an AMBER alert on my phone. 

Most people have smart phones today and I feel a lot of the Amber alerts the vistims are taken by someone they already know.

Can we not use something similar like we did during COVID and alert us when we are near the possible suspect to alert the authorities?

It seems pretty easy, but I'm no rocket scientist.
