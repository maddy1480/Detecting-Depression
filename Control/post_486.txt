I feel like my brain freezes for a few seconds
I occasionally and randomly feel like my brain freezes for a few seconds and it scares me because when I feel like that, I feel like I'm stuck in a state but it doesn't last and I'm fully aware of it  
it can happen to me once a week or more or less  
It also happens to me at certain moments to feel suddenly the sensation of not having confidence in myself anymore, for example just now when I was playing a video game, suddenly I lost confidence in me in one second for no reason and it was a strange state, I wondered why I was doing that and I had the impression to be like in a dissociated state but not totally  
What do you think about it?
