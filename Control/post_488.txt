Seeking Advice: Need to Walk to Find Solutions
I have a challenge that I need your help with.  Whenever I'm faced with a difficult problem or need to come up with a solution, I find it almost impossible to brainstorm while seated. Instead, I have to stand up and walk around inside my house to get any ideas flowing. Whenever I force myself to sit down and try to come up with a plan, I tend to get stressed, and my mind feels blocked. However, I'm concerned about how it might impact my career, where I can't just walk around the place whenever I need a solution.  
Has anyone experienced something similar? Do you have any advice or techniques for brainstorming and problem-solving while sitting?  
Thanks for your insights and suggestions!
