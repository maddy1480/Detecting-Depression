It always rains on my birthday
Yesterday was my birthday and as usual it poured in my country. I started noticing in 2017 and i have memories of pasts years people being annoyed because they couldnt leave the place (where my birthday party was taking place) because of rain. 

This time was awesome, because the day prior my birthday was very sunny then my birthday comes and it is suddenly all cloudy like really gray clouds and as we were going to a restaurante to have dinner it started, everyone was mad they got wet, some of them didn't even have umbrellas, but me ? so happy.

It's kind of a double edge sword, now i wait for it and i expect it to happen, but the moment it does not rain on one of my birthdays i know i'm gonna be sad. Even though i know this is a silly coincidence, i love that it always happens i like to see it as a gift from God or the universe (since i love rain). This is one of the few silly things i allow myself to believe and it has brought me a lot of joy.
