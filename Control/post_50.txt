Talking to Starbucks baristas are so fun!
They are fun and friendly! I started to say good morning to them and always try to make them feel human. It is all too often do people dehumanize service workers. 

I always try to make quick casual conversations with baristas. It really makes their day! 

I just don't feel like treating them like subhuman trash.
