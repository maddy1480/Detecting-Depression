Late Night Friday's has become fun movie night with a group of friends. Anyone else have a nice 'routine' end of week item of sorts they look forward to?
Haaaaaappy Friday and weekend to start :)

Lately with a group of friends we have been doing a late night friday movie streaming online- we all just kinda talk, joke, hangout - discuss the finer points of life like taylor ham or pork roll ðŸ˜‚

It's becoming a nice tradition of sorts - having that end of week cool down - watch some campy/funny movie and hang.

What types of things do you possibly routinely (or semi frequent) to close out a week? 

Our votes are in and it looks like tonight is Scary Movie - it's been a good bit since I've seen that one ðŸ˜‚
