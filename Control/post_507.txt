How should I proceed forward in life
I don’t know if anyone would even read this :P, I’ve written my thoughts as they came to my mind. There is a lot of missing information here, but here it is.

I’m in my early twenties. I have been gaming for a long time in my life. I’ve spent thousands of hours on games like Call of Duty, CSGO, Valorant. Majority of those hours were just mindless gaming, which I hate the most. I regret wasting so much, which I could have used for becoming a better person, learning something useful. On the contrary, I’ve always dreamed of growing up, earning money and building my own PC. Now when I can finally afford to do so, I just can’t justify buying a PC which would enable me to get addicted to gaming again.

I’m a software engineer, working remotely. I already have so many health issues and ideally I should try to engage in more physical activities like gym, yoga or some kind of sports. But, I’ve been gaming so long that at the end of the day I still feel that something is missing and open my laptop to play some games. I’ve tried started reading books, but I get very restless and impatient with them. I just don’t know what to do now. I’m at a phase where I’m not learning anything, just juggling between work and entertainment. I miss my college days very much :(

Has anyone gone through something similar? Were you ever able to change or adopt new habits?
