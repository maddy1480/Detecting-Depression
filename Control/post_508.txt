My team won a hackathon!
Winning was great and all but I don't know wether I should laugh or cry because of the prize. Mind, the organizer was a multinational tech company. I don't know if they are just cheapskates or because the hackathon was just for women or both but the prize was a 30 euro giftcard to a local grocery store ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
