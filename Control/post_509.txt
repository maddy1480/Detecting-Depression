A microwave with no sound, no clock, and only an add 30 seconds button would likely be a big seller.
It’s really the only button I use and I stop the microwave before 0 to avoid the sound. I don’t know anyone that uses those specific buttons like pizza or popcorn. Any feed back before I invest my life savings into this idea?
