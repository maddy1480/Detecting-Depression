Big Grocery Stores?
Just got a Meijer store in my small city.  You would think it was an enemy invasion the way people are talking/swearing/freaking about it.  I happen to love it but feel as though I can't voice that in public.  (Just like I can't voice my political views. lol)  The produce is exceptional.  The meat choices are unheard of around here eg., elk, bison etc.  What are your thoughts about Big Food Stores?
