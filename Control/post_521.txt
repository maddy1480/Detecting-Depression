I passed calculus
Im not very good at math and I’ve been avoiding it since high school, now I’m at a university and I needed to pass this class in order to take my upper division courses, If I failed I would be wasting an entire semester so a lot was on the line. 

I failed my last two tests and failure was imminent but I pulled off the comeback of the year and got a B on my last test and a B- on my final exam. I passed the class with a C but now Im so relieved and excited for fun summer timess
