I feel like I don’t care about music enough
I definitely have favorite songs and I enjoy singing along and going with my friends to see live music but I feel like I never developed that relationship with music as a whole that everyone I know has. 

Like my ex bf was absolutely obsessed with music and had deep opinions and stories about every song he listened to. My best friend always tells me how emotional songs make her and how she cried to Lana del Rey as a teen. Even on social media (tiktok/twitter) I come across people who are just so into an artist seeing them in person is a lifetime experience for them. Everyone seems to be able to just sit down and listen to a new album from their favorite band/artist or they keep up with them and are always aware when concerts are happening or when new music is dropping. Whereas me, I find that I naturally come across songs I like and just add those songs to my likes songs playlist. I don’t ever really just listen to music on my own outside of in the car or doing my makeup. I never seek out new music and I CANT sit and listen any album in it’s entirely without getting bored (Pink Floyd’s the Wall is the one exception of you know what I mean ;)) It’s just completely beyond my understanding. 

I understand shows, movies, and books making people feel intensely because I cry to those constantly (Im actually an extremely emotional person when it comes to everything outside of music) so I don’t think it’s a situation where if it’s not actually happening to me I can’t feel it but I don’t understand why I’m like this

I’ve always felt like this but I’ve never had any real desire to be more into music. Anyone else the same? Maybe there’s something wrong with me lmao
