Fishing trip
Went fishing today at a nearby small lake in the middle of the forest (I live in Finland). I was fishing with a top water lure that I got for christmas and a pike tried to bite onto my lure more than 10 times, but he just barely missed the lure everytime.

 So I didnt catch any fish, but atleast it was fun watching the pike jump up from the water.

 Idk. Just wanted to share with somebody. Please let me hear your fishing stories (:
