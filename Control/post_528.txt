Does anyone dislike the smell of uncooked meat/cheese?
I don't mind them when cooked, or as part of something else, but just on their own, the smell is off-putting.

For example, I was making spaghetti carbonara, and the smell of the cheese basically put me off of it, even though I'm fine with eating it after mixing the cheese in with everything else.

It's basically the same story with raw meat. Raw meat tends to smell rather unpleasant (it's not off, since it smells like that fresh from the butcher), but I'm perfectly fine with the smell and taste after it's been cooked.
