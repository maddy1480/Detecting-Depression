I have managed to ruin a job interview in record breaking time today!
I’ve just been made redundant and have been applying for new jobs, a pretty long and tedious process so far.

I also went to the Chester races last week in an effort to lift my spirits, where I had some alcohol in a hip-flask. That was the last time I wore the suit I decided to go to the interview in.

Low and behold when I take off my blazer jacket following shaking the hands of the interviewers said flask majestically tumbled onto the floor in full view of everyone.

Safe to say I don’t think I got the job. 

Hope you all have a better day than I’m having!
