I finally did it!!!! After many years of bad grades I am a high school GRADUATE
There isn't another place that I know to share this as most of my friends are older and doing their own thing now. Rewind a few years - I was a bright eyed freshman ready to begin high school. The first semester was ok grade wise and I didn't fail anything but then COVID came. When we got sent home for the rest of the year my grades absolutely dropped off the earth. I hated ZOOM and online work. Couldn't do it. I ended up failing two classes and making them up in summer school. The same story kind of lingered into the second year of high school and then when we finally went back to school for real I had a failing GPA, barely. My counselor basically told me that I needed to pull my grades back up, but it didn't happen that year. Ended back in summer school to redo english and algebra. My grades stayed around that pass/fail mark through the first semester of junior year. My counselor told me this was it and I needed to kick it into gear to get good enough grades to graduate on time. So I actually started doing some work, and making better grades, but barely better. Still had to go to summer school to redo a science class. By senior year my counselor spelled out what grades I needed to get. And i'm happy to say that I took my last test and PASSED. My overall GPA is .01 over the required passing mark for my high school!! So excited to get the heck out of this education system!

\*on reflection, I did not work very hard in school, but I also don't see the utility in learning certain things that wont be used in adult life. No, Mr. Harris, learning about the quadratic equation will not help me learn how to be a successful adult.
