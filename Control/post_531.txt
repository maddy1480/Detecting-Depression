Eagles chatting
I’m sitting here, riding out the heat wave we’re having, with windows shut and ‘heat pump’ on cool.  We live on one side of a small sort-of canyon, and we’re pretty sure there are eagles nesting on top of the hillside we face (we’ve seen SO much bird activity up there this year!).  It’s very cool because, even with the window and blinds closed, I can still hear the eagles calling right now!!
