What are some odd jobs and the Accessories that come with them?
I think when you get a new job or hobby, it incorporates into your "look". Like, when I volunteered at a radio station they gave me a brand T-shirt and a key card and anxiety. And it's only kind of an accessory, but I found myself carrying donuts and snacks for people too. Or an artist might carry around a lot of pencils or have paint stained clothing.

Pretty straightforward, but I wanted to ask around 'cause... There's a lot of jobs I've never heard of!

What's an odd job or task that you had (or heard of), and did you get equipment from it?
