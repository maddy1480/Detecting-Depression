What's your favorite way to waste an hour in a waiting room?
Whenever I'm at the airport, in a waiting room, waiting for the train etc I always find myself with like 30mins-hour to kill.  

Airport I walk as much as possible.  I feel like I'm actually doing something and being slightly productive. 

Train stop or waiting room I'm stuck, what's your go to move?
