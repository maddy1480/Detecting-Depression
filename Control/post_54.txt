Just requested time off for a long vacation
I’ve known for a long time that I am completely burnt out and unmotivated at work but I’ve been hesitant to take any more than a day off because there’s just so much to catch up on when I get back.  But I realized today that I just don’t care.  I need a break, I have plenty of vacation time, and the last two weeks of June will be a perfect time to get away from everything.

I have nothing actually planned as of now.  Maybe I’ll go camping.  Or take a few day trips.  Or help my parents with some things.  Or read a dozen books.  Or just watch movies with my cats for two weeks straight (one of my goals in life is to watch every Oscar-nominated film).

I really don’t care if I do anything “productive” with my time off.  I haven’t had a real vacation since 2018.  The next couple of months are going to be hell, but I feel a little bit lighter knowing that I’ve got a much-needed break coming.

How would you spend a long vacation, and do you have any recommendations for making the best of it?
