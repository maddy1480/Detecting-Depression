I was balding a bit and shaved my head, but then decided to just go back balding
So I'm balding on top, but I've been complimented on how I look and never really minded it. However some friend talked me into shaving it and I hated it. Not his fault though, I also was reading how a lot of women prefer bald guys over balding so I did it. In my opinion, looked way worse. Decided to just grow it back to previous balding state lol  and its basically there and I like it way more. 

Just shows, do what you want.
