Something that helped me reduce procrastinating
I have had an extreme problem with discipline and procrastination for as long as I can remember. I will procrastinate even the most basic and simple things (like doing laundry, or paying a bill I have the money for) for so long untill it becomes an actual problem. It is the worst when I study. I think I have finally found something that helped. I just repeat "stop taking the easy way out".

 It sounds so simple but it actually helps me. Whenever I don't want to go and work out, or run that errand, or spend hours and hours doing literally nothing while I have to submit my thesis in a week I just tell myself over and over again that if I want to be a succesfull person I have to do things I don't want to do. I will have to do hard things. I have to do this thing that I don't like. It has become like a mantra in my head. "stop taking the easy way" "you are not a weak person". It's not some magic solution and I still procrastinate but I certainly have been more productive. It has helped me overcome some sort of mental blockade.

sorry for rambling and it probably won't mean much to anyone but I can't really share this with anyone in real life so I thought I'd post here.
