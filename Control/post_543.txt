I actually can't imagine getting angry at service staff
I don't think I've ever once gotten angry at service staff. I read all the time about customers getting angry and screaming at staff over the smallest things. Maybe it's the way I was raised or the culture I grew up in, but it does happen here in Ireland too. I just can't imagine getting angry at somebody who is literally serving me, a nobody, and doing it for shitty pay. The whole time with waiters or cashiers I'm just focusing on saying the right things, communicating what I want, and trying to not seem nervous lol. Like even when service staff have been rude or had some kind of a tone, it's annoying, but again, shitty pay and shitty work, so I just brush it off.

Does anyone have any insight into why people do this?
