Why is finding an apartment so hard
I live in a city with house prices above the average wrt the rest of the country and finding an apartment to rent that isn't the size of a closet at an affordable price is being a challenge. 

When I found a good deal I had to be extra careful gathering info etc because apparently you can't trust anyone and sure enough it was a scam.

Why is it so complicated to find a place to live
