Calling In-Laws Mom and Dad. Kinda throws me off.
I've been thinking of this for some time. First off I'm not married yet but I've heard of In Laws calling their son or daughters s/o "daughter /son" I've always felt uncomfortable by that because it looks as if the significant others are brother and sister. Essentially sounding incestuous. Just want people's respectful thoughts on this.
