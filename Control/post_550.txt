Upgraded home gym
Hello,

Im so f8cking happy I finally added equipment to my home gym.

An adjustable bench. Also, an adjustable bench/squat/deadlift rack. 

Which I spent $130 on, not a bad price based on the quality of the product I received.
I can pretty much hit all muscle groups with the three pieces of equipment I have. I dont have to spend time and monry on a gym membership. Also saving money on gas/car maintenance. Ahhhhh

Thank you facebook market place for cheap weights/equipment AHHHHH I would have shot someone for this shit back when I was a teenager.
