I read a comment on Reddit that changed my daily behaviour for the better
"Everytime I go into a room I look for three things to clean"

I don't remember exactly which post I read it on (twas long ago, well feels like it anyway), so good chance that's not verbatim, but that's what I do now everyday.

House is still a mess at times, but always that little bit cleaner then before. Big thanks anonymous guru, I appreciate you!

Anyone experienced something similar?
