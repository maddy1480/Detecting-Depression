I can’t wait for the shocked-faces-in-thumbnails trend to end.
It is so tiring and cringe inducing to see 90% of my YouTube homepage is just a shocked face with a bunch of colorful bold words.
They say it attracts more views because you mindlessly click on a video to see what they’re so shocked about, but that was maybe 2 years ago when it was still a new concept. Now it’s doing the opposite effect because I will literally not click on a shocked face unless I read the title and I’m actually interested in the video content.
