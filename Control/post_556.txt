I finally found something I want to do with my life.
So I had a horrible childhood that left me pretty broken and started doing therapy last year and it's helped so much. I'm a much happier person, a much better husband. It really helped me all around.

I finally found a career that I'm happy about and that I want to do but it's odd. I want to become a Mortician. I want to help take care of people on their journey to their next phase of existence, and help them find rest. I really want to help families get through those difficult times by cleaning their loved ones and making them look nice for open casket funerals. I hate seeing blood so I know that might seem odd that I want to be a Mortician, but I know it's something I can get over. I've done lots of research and I know you see, touch, and smell some truly gruesome stuff.

It's the only career that's ever caught my true interest where I think I could do it without being totally bored or miserable.
