People in Paris are so nice
Growing up in the 90s, I was told Parisians are rude and won’t like you if you cannot speak French. But in my time in Paris in recent years, I’ve not found a single person who was not super nice despite my lack of French. People in Paris are wonderful! 14/10 highly recommend visiting.
