Going vegetarian improved my quality of life very quickly.
Let me start off by saying the only reason I went vegetarian was to lose weight. I have no moral issues with meat. I also don’t think meat is necessarily unhealthy. I just think that is usually comes paired with ingredients that aren’t healthy. Now straight to the benefits I experienced: 

1. My focus has drastically improved. I have zero brain fog and feel less distraction.

2. I feel well rested. No grogginess. I no longer need caffeine in the morning. I also don’t “crash” after I eat lunch.

3. Bloating/inflammation has decreased. My eyes aren’t as puffy. I’m stomach doesn’t stick out as much.

For background I’m a 27M who use to eat whatever as long as it had some protein. I have only been on this diet for a week. My main meal has been tofu and rice. I sometimes eat fruit or a smoothie but that’s it usually it.
