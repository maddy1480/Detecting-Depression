The cemetery on Mother's Day
On Mother's Day this past Sunday, my husband, daughter and I were out and about and happened to drive past the cemetery in our city. I'd never seen the cemetery so full of flowers and balloons before and it took me a second to realize why... It was Mother's Day. 

It broke my heart. The image of the sea of heart shaped balloons and flowers left at almost every gravesite is burned into my mind, and I can't stop thinking about the fact that someday I'll lose my mom and someday my daughter will lose me. It's very sad, but it's also served as a reminder to make my mom feel appreciated and loved now; to tell her that I love her, and that I am so thankful for everything she's done for me and my two siblings. She's the nicest, hardest working person I know, and she'd do anything for us kids. She's the mom I aspire to be for my own daughter. 

I also wanted to offer my condolences for anyone here who's lost their mom. You are incredibly strong for going through that.

Mods, sorry if this isn't the right sub, feel free to delete, but I just wanted to share my feelings with others.
