What kind of friendships do you have and how do they look like in practice?
Ive started to think of friendships and I want inspiration.   
Could you short describe one or some friendships you have?  


Example questions to answer if relevant:  
How often do you meet or hear from eachother? Is it regular or irregular?  
Do you meet at home, meet outside, call, SMS, snapchat, letters?  
Do you plan or is it spontaneous? Who takes initiative?  
Is it a fixed established friend group, different  every time, or usually hang out one friend at the time?  
What topics do you talk about? What activities do you do?
