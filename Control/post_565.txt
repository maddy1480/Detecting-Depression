I've been unknowingly making naan bread for years.
You know when you've been doing something you think is of your own thought, but then you find out it already has a name and someone did it first?

Well, I've apparently been making naan\* for years and had no idea. I just happen to love homemade bread, and happen to love yoghurt on my dough. I developed what I thought was my own recipe. I didn't share this with my family until yesterday, since I cook only for me and my husband mostly; but yesterday we were chatting about cooking, I told them about this bread I love, and my sister goes 'oh, so you're making naan bread'.

I had never ever heard about it, but after checking most of the recipes online, indeed; I have been making naan, very exactly so.

It's a funny coincidence that my cooking train of thought was unintentionally the same than someone from India/Middle East when they invented that recipe!

\*Edit: someone told me the word naan already means bread, so corrected the word in the text. At least now you can laugh at the title that basically says 'I've been making bread bread'
