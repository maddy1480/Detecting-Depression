2 types of Role models
I think there are two types of role models we can have. 
One being someone whom we interact with, be it a friend, teacher, family member etc.

The other being a personality who inspires us but with whom we dont interact. For eg, Martin luther king jr., or any other distant personality.

I feel that having a real role model expedites the process of becoming like them (in whatever area one admires them) bcos there is a live example to see.

What do you people think?
