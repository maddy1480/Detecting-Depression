Why do we not help the other primates evolve?
Gorillas, Orangutans, Chimpanzees; Do you think we don't teach other primates how to evolve because we are afraid they would make us extinct?

Like surely we could get a group people together. Have those people go out and meet a pack of gorilla or orangutan, or chimpanzee. Then teach them how to make fire. Then teach them to not let the fire get out of control.
