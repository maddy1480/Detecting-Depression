I managed to finish Microbiology and Physiology this semester, both with As!
I really have nothing to say other than I'm really proud of myself. In the beginning of the year my Microbio professor was telling the class "Don't take this class with Physio, you will regret it!" which got me really scared. To be fair, Microbio and Physio are known to be some of the "hardest prereqs", and taking them together in the same semester was a death sentence to some. But luckily, I managed to pull through it, and ended with a 90.5 in Physio and 91.2 in Microbio. I would've died in Physio have it not been for my amazing lab partner (love you Eligio), and all the friends I made in the classes. My Physio professor also really loved me, as I quote, because of my "quirky personality". ðŸ˜‚

The only thing I was sad about was in the end when I had to say goodbye to them, especially my lab partner, as he's moving to Oregon. Hopefully we'll cross paths again one day... ðŸ¥²
