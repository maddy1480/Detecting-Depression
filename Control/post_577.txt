Is it awkward to tell someone that you’ve dreamt with them?
In my life when I’ve dreamt with someone and seen them soon after, I sometimes tell them that they were in my dreams. Nothing NSFW but even so, people sometimes seemed a bit confused/uncomfortable.
Yesterday I dreamt with a mate from my dance class and I held back telling him, in part because he was a serial killer in my dream and maybe it’s not pleasant to hear.
Anyways, do you think it’s acceptable, frowned upon, TMI? Curious to see what people thinks
