A friend of mine that I only see a few times a year is wanting me to help him move out of his apartment this week
For context, he's not my best friend or anything. I only see him a few times a year just to catch up. We share similar hobbies so we bond over that. But he reaches out to me today asking if I can help him move furniture out of his apartment on Thursday. He didn't offer to pay me anything or get me lunch or anything like that ... just to literally help him move once I get off work. 

Seems a little weird, right? I bust my ass at my day job and I'm tired by the time I get home. Plus, time is valuable. I work on my side business after work and have to make time for my wife. Just seems a little rude for him to just reach out and ask me to help him move when I get off work. I feel like that kind of favor is reserved for only the closest of friends that you've known your whole life. 

I just find it obnoxious when people ask for big favors but offer nothing in return. I'm a bit taken back by him asking me this. How should I respond, and do you find this a bit repulsive too?
