Although having social anxiety, I applied for a all-rounder job at a Mexican restaurant
Not trying to bragg here, I'm just looking for advices as this is very new and challenging for me (I'm an Asian in Australia). I really want to slowly get to work in retail/hospitality instead of working in a factory as I am at the moment. My English is fine in term of listening but my accent is told to be unclear and I dont really good at communication either. Still, I need to try to improve my skills. Just hope for the best.
