Lost all interest in spending time playing games that I would always feel motivated to log in to and improve at. Anyone ever felt this way about anything and figured out how to fix it?
Just was curious if anyone else has ever had this weird slump. Seemingly out of nowhere I just have no motivation to play any of the competitive games I've had loads of fun streaming and practicing over the past few months/years; things I've always enjoyed logging in to and pushed myself to get really good at suddenly have no pull on me and my decisions for what to do with free time. This isn't a case of dropping something because of balancing frustrating me and doesn't feel similar to any burnout I've experienced. Anyone ever been here before and got any advice on how to get back to enjoying these things again?
