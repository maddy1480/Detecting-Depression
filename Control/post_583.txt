I have completed my thesis and I finally feel proud of myself!
Hi everyone! I cannot share it with many people, and it's not such a big deal, but this morning I finished my thesis, almost without any help, as my supervisor didn't really support me throughout the process. During my years at the university, it's the first time I feel proud of something I have accomplished. I still have a chance to obtain an excellent degree, and that will be my next challenge. (Im a CS student)
