Crazy fight happened at school
this story happened last year, but first i need to explain a little bit of the layout( TLDR at end):-

my class was on the ground floor , when you exit the class there is a small hallway with a bathroom at the end with a staircase beside it that led to the outside. when we had recess everyone would go outside to hang out with friends,So this day i went outside, talked with friends, and as i am walking back i look down the staircase and there are two dudes, one a hostel warden and the other looked like a father they were duking it out by grabbing collars and punching each other in the face.Eventually everyone gathered around and the head P.E teacher stopped it, apparently (again these are rumors) the hostlers say that the warden was messaging the father's daughter and when he found out he started a fight

TLDR:- hostel warden messages little girl and gets into fight with her father
