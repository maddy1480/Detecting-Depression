It’s my birthday today and I’m home alone.
Happy birthday to those I share with by the way!

I’m 29 and this is the first time in awhile I’ll be celebrating it for the majority of the day alone. It’s sort of refreshing. It so happened to fall on a day off from work too. I don’t want to waste the day! I have a doctors appointment and will probably attend to chores in reality lol

If you had the whole day to yourself, what’re some things you’d like to do on your birthday?
