Are there any people with good paying jobs they hate?
I’ve been seeing the studying what you love vs what brings in the money conversation and unfortunately have seen people who studied/ followed their passions and ended up broke and (I’m assuming) unhappy. Not sure if I’ve seen anyone with a good paying job hating their lives.
