I'm so glad I finally have a cat
I had cats as a kid and loved it, but then in adulthood, I just kept having to wait -- I was moving around too much, or was too poor, or in unsuitable roommate situations -- a million reasons I couldn't responsibly have my own cat. I finally adopted one in 2020 and she's the best. I'm so happy I have my little buddy following me around the house and snuggling up next to me. She meows whole conversations at me, loves to be picked up and held, and has liked every human she's ever met except one (and frankly I  kind of take that as a red flag about that person!) My partner is a total cat person convert now too after not growing up with pets. It took over 10 years of pining wistfully but now I finally live the cat life again. 

Is there anyone out there who's currently in the "waiting" phase? You've got my sympathies! It takes patience!
