Is It true that Junior year is the most challenging year of high school in terms of academics?
I’m curious to know people’s experiences in their junior year, and how they handled stress and time management etc. My friends who are in that grade seem like they aren’t handling it so well, so I’m nervous to go into it myself, seeing as I already have a lot of homework as it is now. Does anyone have any personal experiences with this or advice they want to share?
