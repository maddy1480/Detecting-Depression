I just discovered Creamy Sunbutter, and my life is forever changed.
This may seem small, but this discovery is making me *so* thrilled!

I'm severely allergic to nuts, and I've always been jealous of everyone who gets to enjoy peanut butter in all its glory. 

I ordered some creamy Sunbutter, and I was hesitant about it. But it is SO good, and I even tricked my father in law â€” he thought it was peanut butter!
