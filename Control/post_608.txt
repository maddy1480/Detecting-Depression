What is actually easier DONE than said?
I get annoyed by the phrase "Easier said than done" because it's so vague and applies to most things so it's basically meaningless to use as some kind of reason or excuse to do or not to do something, which it often is.

Got me thinkin though, what are some things that are actually easier done than said?

My favorite one pulled off the first google result was

"Doing stuff yourself
Because getting work done by others can be frustrating."
