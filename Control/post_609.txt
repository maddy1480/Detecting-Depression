I feel being attractive is a superpower
I've been struggling with my self-image for basically forever. Whenever I'm shirtless in my bathroom I turn a little to see a reflection of my belly in the mirror. I was obese for most of childhood, and then started taking better care of myself. 

Now I'm at a healthy weight, but I noticed something: there is a HUGE difference in how I'm treated by random people if I'm just 1-2 kg slimmer than my current weight. Right now I'm healthy looking with a not exactly flat belly, but the margin is bery small and the difference is night and day. If I'd lose the 2 kilos of weight, I know I'd get passersby looking at me more, I'd get more attention from store clerks and so on, because it's happened so many times already!

Since people flock to those they find attractive (I know I do), the superpower I then possess is the ability to brighten up their days a little bit. When I get more attention I always try to sneak in some little compliment into the random encounters! If they consider me attractive, I'll use the opportunity to throw some kindness back at them hoping it will make them feel a bit better about themseves. Hopefully a little kindness can go a long away and change people's negative views of others perceive them.
