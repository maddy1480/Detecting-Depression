Funny story about me getting drunk... at age 4.
So here's the deal. I was taken to a party, I believe for the super bowl in 2013. My mom wanted to find a babysitter, but she couldn't find one, so I just tagged along. My mom went to go talk to her friends, so I was unsupervised. I felt pretty thirsty, so I walked over to the refreshment table. Now here's where  the fun begins. I saw a drink in one of those clear, lever water containers, and was super excited and was like "Oooooh, lemonade!" I thought it tasted really good, so I had another. And another. I ended up drinking 3 lemonades. It wasn't filled with lemonade though. It was filled with mimosa. I had 3 MIMOSAS AT AGE 4. I told my mom to ask what the lemonade was, and her face dropped. When I told her I had 3, she was shocked. So I got driven home, put to bed, and woke up with a hangover. At age 4.
