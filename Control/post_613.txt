Anyone else buy and have makeup, but don't have enough confidence to wear it in public?
Throughout the years, I have bought so much makeup and accumulated so much stuff and I've watched so many beauty YouTubers and tutorials. Though it doesn't feel like it fits well with my face or feels normal at all. 

Anyone else have that issue? 

Just chit chatting about how different women felt comfortable wearing makeup or getting better at it.
