Just missed a concert and maybe it was a good thing
I knew when my family said we'd wait for my sister, we were at the very least going to miss some of the show. We ended up missing the entire thing. I'm nearly off to college, though, and I'll soon be able to go to some by myself. 

I didn't want my first concert to be with my family anyway. I don't like them very much. It'll be nice to have that memory juuust for myself instead!
