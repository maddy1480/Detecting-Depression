Want to get a tattoo but can't picture it
I want to get a tattoo, of a sort of vine/branch with thorns and Daisys on as a representation of sort of hope and hardships.
I want it to sort of wrap around the arm but not entirely, more particularly. I also don't want it to look like every other tattoo I want it to be different and original. Something unique that one does not see often. But in a black and white design.

I plan to add alot of tattoos not all the same, so preferably something that won't clash with something else as well 

 Any ideas?
