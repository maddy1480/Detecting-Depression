I'm stuck in this phase of not being able to have a open conversation with someone even close.
I'm 25 and I did my grads in a mechanical field and recently switched to tech. I did learn a lot and now landed in a really good tech firm. This made me meet a lot of highly motivated people who've been enthusiastic about tech since their college and greatly different minded ones. But also, on the other side created this imposter syndrome in me that avoided me having open non judgemental conversations with them since I have the fear of coming out as a person who needs to be taught or doesn't know stuffs. Also had me break off saying "Oh that scaling method, yea yea!" And then I had to read through about that and get back onto what the initial conversation was about. Yes, I do know, stopping them right away and asking it does help. But there had been situations I've been mocked for my stupidity. This made me have really shallow conversations with people at work and never been able to turn any conversation personal. Also because most of my peers have a different mother tongue, I'm unable to convey thoughts like they do along. This already being a problem, made me also recognise the same among my friends whom I've been with since schooling. I'm now hesitant to make open unjudged conversations with them, not because of the fear of being judged, but I had lost the ability to make dumb/funny unproductive open ended talks with people. This is heavily concerning and help me through this.

Update: I do appreciate many of you are helpful with the imposter syndrome and please do drop more ideas around it. But my prime concerning factor over that is why/what is stopping me having a genuine pointless conversations with my buddies. Why am I feeling stressed and thinking before I start a conversation.
