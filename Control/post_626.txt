Today I learned that its pique your interest and not "peak".
So I was reading an article about the PGA today and they said something about hoping the PGA will pique the interest into people who has never golfed before. So I thought to myself, "Is that even right?". I go and google it and it turns out that it was in fact.........right lol. Goes to show that I have been a dumbass for 30+ years and noone has corrected me. ðŸ’€
