Topics that interest you?
Hello there people of this digital realm!

I noticed I only know about the topics that I know (if that makes sense), but there could be so many topics that I don't know or have not been exposed to. Not only being exposed to, but having  a different perspective on some topic. This has led me to ask:

What kind of topics are you interested in at the moment? What got you interested in it?

It could be books and how they are printed, learning to improve one's cooking skills... Anything really. Anything that you are currently invested in or want to learn/understand.

For example:

I'm currently interested in cleaning. How being able to clean something as soon as it is used makes it a lot easier to clean than leaving it to the side. How each material requires their own chemicals to clean them.
