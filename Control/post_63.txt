Tips to focus in class?
I’m in class right now and although I know I should be listening I can’t bring myself to do so. I zone out when I feel that some information doesn’t benefit me, im just simply uninterested. Since I still get good grades I don’t have any reason to try, but I feel as though I’m not reaching my full potential. Any tips?
