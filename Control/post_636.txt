Looking for encouragement
I made a decision to accept another job offer. I need to resign from my current job immediately because I've only been there two weeks and I want to take time off before I start new job in two weeks. I need encouragement to stand up for myself and JUST DO IT. I'm goin to send the resignation email tomorrow morning. I feel guilty. I need encouragement because I'm programmed to people please. Any positive thoughts will help. Thank you:)
