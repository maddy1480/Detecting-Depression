looking for someone fun and exciting
HI I'm 35 and I'm from the US but I wasn't born and raised here. I moved here in 2017.  
I have a hobby of reading books. I really like books about autobiography, motivation, investment and business.  
I really love to eat, my wish is to retire early and spend my old age traveling the world and trying all the new foods in the world.  
I have traveled to Europe and Asia but I like Asia more because I think the food in Asia is very good, especially I like Thailand.
