Have you tried just being willing?
This is something that wasn't always easy for me. Sometimes I would have so much friction when being with certain people. Always magnifying their annoying habits many times in my mind. We all know about this, right? Certain people we are not gelling with. But then I realized that my social interactions would feel so much better if I looked at everyone with kindness and love in my heart. I started seeing people as just another life like I am, and everyone with their own limitations and issues. Somehow I started feeling compassion for everyone. And this is when it all changed for me. After I started being open and speaking to anyone in a joyful and accepting manner, the way people respond to me is totally different. You must try this. Try to see the best in someone you find very annoying. Recognise them for the best you have seen in them. See how the situatuon changes both within and without. "Anything you do willingly can become a great pleasure and a process of growth for you." - Sadhguru.
