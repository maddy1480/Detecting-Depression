As I'm 1000 miles from home in a local coffee shop, I feel like we miss out on spontaneous socializing these days
It makes me wish there was an app that actually worked as intended just to meet people for casual (strictly and totally platonic) meetups! I'd love to find a local to show me around or just to grab a coffee with. Obviously this would never work and it would probably be overrun with creeps. However, as an outgoing, yet initially shy aspiring writer, it'd be nice to be able to meet interesting new people while I travel for simple conversation or for them to tell me their stories :)
