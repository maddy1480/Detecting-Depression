How do younger generations view the 90s?
I was born in the early 80s, and I always saw decades like the 70s and 60s as this far away time in the past, almost like it was a completely different planet.  So Iâ€™m curious how people born after 2000 or so see the 90s.  Do you see that decade like I think of the 1970s, or do you think of it as basically like the present day, just with less technology?
