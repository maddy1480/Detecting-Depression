human lives
if we could live 500 or 600 years, our lives would be so much different. we weren't living with the laws we are living now, our moral values would be changed. I think we could have lived a better life because we would have had a lot of time to mess up things and learn from them. if only that could possible I would be so much happier. It still doesn't change the fact that we are insignificant compared to this extremely enormous universe but we could have experienced it a little longer which would be an amazing thing. or maybe I am wrong if a human being is capable of doing evil things when he has a really short life who knows what would we do if we exist for more than five hundred years?
