I hid Easter eggs at work and it's killing me not telling someone
We're at lunch right now. Middle age construction workers btw. After we all went to lunch I acted like I forgot something, went back in the work area, and hid about 15 Easter eggs full of candy. Nobody suspects a thing, and in my 15 years of being in construction I've only seen this done once so it's definitely not normal. I'm intrigued as to how this will all play out. 

I only hid about 15 eggs, and there's about 30 people working in here from different trades, so it's not that big of a deal. But should still hopefully be kind of a cool surprise for a few people.
