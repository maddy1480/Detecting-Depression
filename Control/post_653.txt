What is something your parents forced you to learn as a child that you are now grateful you did?
Think sports, arts, instruments or language/s.
Something you hated as a child or found it hard or never saw the point of it but now as an adult you're really happy that your parents made you learned it.

For me, it was taking swimming classes, I hated going because there was a coach who used to yell a lot and was really scary looking (for a child at least) but I've discovered that with the amount of people who can't swim as adults, I'm so happy my parent put me in these classes.
