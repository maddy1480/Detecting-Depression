why does temeprature and humidity rises as I wet the cement surface?
This month, in philippines, warmer weather still occurs, and I'm trying to wet all the floor before evening in afternoon about 5:30 PM. Then it feels more sweaty and warmer. How does it happen? Also it occurs even after short rain.
