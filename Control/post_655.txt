not having internet to answer questions was not cool
i grew up in a village and its late 90's early 2000's so we didnt had internet. there was this tv show with a character that was doing some kind of metalwork. his dream was to buy a "cnc machine". i didnt knew what lathe was or what cnc was. and nobody in my village didnt knew either. it was driving me crazy. and i havent developed enough brain to check the encyclopedia.  i really liked that show and could not figure out what the guy actually doing. but thank god couple years later i moved to a bigger city and was run into a metal worker with a lathe and a cnc machine. he explained everything to me and told me the cost of a cnc machine.
