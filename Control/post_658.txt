waiting for friend to play xbox so i can ask him about a girl I like
I like this girl but i have no form of contact. I just want to have a conversation and see if maybe theirs a chance.


Only person that talks to her is my xbox friend. I could probably pass along my number to her using my friend as a bridge.


Only issue is that this friend has been MiA on xbox, he leaves his xbox on all day while hes doing something else or is outside.

I send him a message to talk and play but he has not answered yet.

 I have heard from that friend that she was asking about me the other day and if I had moved.
