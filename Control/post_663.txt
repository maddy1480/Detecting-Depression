I bumped a parked car at the grocery store today, 2 weeks after getting my drivers license and I feel horrible. Anhyone remember their first bump/ minor crash ?
  
So I was out today with my grandfather's car, went to the grocery store and I got into the parking lot but I accidentally went the wrong entry (I was at the exit way), anyway I'm trying to back off scared shitless I'm gonna hit someone on the back, and this guy comes towards me with a big truck just bursting out yelling and doing hand motion, and in my mind I'm like "oh he means come forward because maybe I'll fit" and lo and behold I just went straight into a freaking car parked there. I just became a mess and I couldn't even get my car out of the  way and had to call my granddad to help me out, luckily the guy didn't ask for much money and didn't want to get the police involved since it was a little scratch, but my granddad's car is fucked the part near the light is cracked and kind of busted out of place, I currently don't have the money to get it fixed since I just gave it all I had saved to the guy whose car I bumped, and my grandad absolutely doesn't want to except money from me, since I'm still a uni student and don't have a proper job. I just feel like a a-hole rn, and questioning if I should even drive again smhhhhh
