How to finish mentally with bad talks
Hey all together,

I have a minor problem. Minor bc it annoys me sometimes, but it has no priority today. 
I had a talk with a stranger girl I just heard stories about. We're active in the same sport. I didn't like her (and still do) and it seemed to be that she didn't like me too. That day, when we first met in present, I asked her what the problem was bc she was bitchy to me. She told me basically, I behaved like I'm really good but I wasn't. 
Sure, I might not be that successful as her, but that's not my goal. I'm not so much into competitions and do it just for fun. I also could have said many things to her (like not everyone has that support as she has, she knows nothing about me and still wants to judge me). But they didn't come to my mind. 

So now I sometimes think about her and it makes me mad (maybe a bit jealous, bc I don't participate in competitions; but I am neither good enough for one and second I couldn't get there). 
How do you guys finish mentally with situations where you had said something but got the idea later on (way after the talk)?
