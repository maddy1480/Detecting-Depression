I talk to everyone but nobody likes me :(
I have group of people that I work together with. In that group I have a friend who talks to everyone and everyone seems to like him. I show kindness to to my members or don't interrupt them when they are talking. We have group chat too. Everyone seems to reply this this guy that when sends text in the group but when I do no one at all replies to message :( I'm not sure I'm doing wrong or what's reason they don't like me.
