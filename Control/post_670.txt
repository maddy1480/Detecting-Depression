How many people can tell the difference between coke and Pepsi?
Idk if it's a personal thing or marketing but I can't tell the difference between either Pepsi nor coke. There must be a difference because they have a significant rivalry. Is it a competition they caused to drive up sales? 

For those who might ask, I prefer Dr Pepper lol.
