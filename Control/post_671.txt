Finally, I got the energy to take my dog for a walk every day this week!
She just had a spay surgery and has been healing up for a month or two now. I have been kind if sad and ij my bed a lot lately but I decided once she was healed I'd start getting back into shape and go for walks. This entire week as soon as I wake up in the morning I take her for a 2 mile walk and we get home and I take a shower and enjoy my day.

Honestly it has made me a lot more happy and I have actually been going to sleep on time. I've even lost about 15 pounds!

I want to continue doing this. I think it is fair to take the weekends off for the both of us and rest. I hope it makes her happy too
