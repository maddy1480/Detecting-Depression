Looking for some advice about my book
So I've recently decided to start writing a book. It's very complicated and to long to explain right now, however I need some ideas for some abilities for the characters in the book.

The way the power system works is that according to your zodiac animal, if you train hard enough you will be granted certain abilities.

I have some down right now for example:

Ox: Triple strength of human, speed of an ox, however stamina is low, after one charge or 30 minutes of labour you require rest. 

Rooster: Can hop/glide for short distances, hollow bones to reduce weight however due to hollow bones, fracturing/breaking them is a higher risk. Loud screech ability that deafens anyone in a 10 meter radius, can only be used once per hour due to negative impact on throat.

The only real rule is that it has to have some sort of weakness in order to not make it over powered but also not under powered.

Thanks in advance.
