Drinking Juice out of a bowl
I might be a little weird for this, but every now, not often, I pour myself a small bowl of juice to drink or sip out of.I don't fill it the rim, only like a centimeter of juice. For some reason the drink always tastes a little better and it makes me feel like royalty. Like I'm drinking out of large chalice. Has anyone tried or done this before? Lol.
