I love remote work life, my health has improved because of it
I can’t believe we were forced to go to the office every single day before covid. I can’t handle that anymore, I love being able to work, run errands, exercise in front of my home, and not worry about commuting. 

I can go to the bathroom without having to use a public restroom or worry about using the bathroom too much.
