If someone from 1958 time traveled to 1973, they would think their time machine malfunctioned and they were actually in 2073. If someone from 2008 time traveled to 2023, they would think their time machine malfunctioned and they were actually in 2010.
Think about it. Most people didn't even have personal toilets in 1958 or hot water, you had to wear a hat and trim your hair because it was greasy, the European colonies where still there, and segregation and conservatism on all things even in fashion and consumer products were prevalent.

In 1973 almost everyone had good interior plumbing and housecleaning products, people no longer had to go to the barber and wear hats to hide their unwashed hair, civil rights , great society, the space race, decolonization, cheap air travel, way different clothes and product designs, and people perhaps were overdoing it in all things even music, even communism was acceptable. All of this change in just 15 years.

Meanwhile, 2008 was 15 years ago, and the biggest change is that smartphone screens are larger lol.
