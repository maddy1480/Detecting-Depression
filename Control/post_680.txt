Why don't some of my friends ever express any 'extreme' opinions?
Whether we discuss movies or music or tv shows or food, two or three of my friends never seem to say things like "I hate that song" or "I hated that movie" or "that actor is amazing" or "I loved that TV show". They only prefer to share very neutral opinions..."that movie was alright"

I feel like I am living in the twilight zone.
