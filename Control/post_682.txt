Why do some people set the goal of being in a relationship, regardless of who they are with?
I have noticed that some people seem to have a very strong desire to be in a relationship, even if they don't have a specific person in mind. They just want to have a partner, any partner, as long as they are not alone. I find this very puzzling and somewhat sad. I don't understand how someone wants be in a relationship before they even meet the right person. Isn't that putting the cart before the horse? I'm not judging anyone, I just want to hear what people think. Am I the odd one out?
