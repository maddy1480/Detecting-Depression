Does anyone else never check their YouTube notifications?
Like, not the notifications letting you know someone you subscribed to posted a new video or something. The comment notifications! I have literally never bothered going back to something I commented to see if people like or dislike it, or argue against it. So I just have a shit ton of random comments out in the world that I don’t even know their current status on, like abandoned kids lmao. Not that I care that much about votes, but I do like seeing different people’s perspectives ‘n whatnot. I’m not perfect, no one is. Unless you’re my cats. Then you can get a belly rub.
