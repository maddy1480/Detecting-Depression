I figured out a recipe on my own!!
Okay I know this is such a stupid thing to be excited about but I’ve always wanted to get into cooking but couldn’t be bothered. Didn’t have much energy to cook due to being a bit heavier but since losing the weight I have the energy to get into cooking and my meals have been so fun to cook.


Tonight I wanted to try to make something new and decided to try Buffalo Chicken Dip. I didn’t look up a recipe or anything I just guessed the whole way through based on what I thought would make it better and it didn’t just come out good. It came out FANTASTIC. I’ve been riding this high for like 20 minutes because I MADE MY OWN RECIPE :D
