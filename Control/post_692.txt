A random earthquake ramble
I’m Californian, but never in my life have I actually felt an earthquake, until earlier today. The epicenter was pretty far away so it was pretty slight, but still noticeable. Nothing got knocked over or anything, but window blinds kinda shook! It doesn’t feel like you think it would. You’d imagine it would feel shaky, like when something large is rolling across an upper floor of a building, but this one felt closer to being on waves in water! I’d almost say it’s a little disorienting when it takes you by surprise like that!

I live in the valley, far from where earthquakes are common. The past few times there was an earthquake that could be felt here (tbh I can count them on one hand) I was either asleep or couldn’t notice. Most recently was 2021, where an even larger one came about and everyone I know felt it… except for me, I was working in an Amazon warehouse in an upper floor where the conveyers and carts going about made it basically impossible to feel, and that’s not even considering the building’s seismic protection. But my current job is in an older single story building so I was finally able! It feels like I went through a Californian rite of passage. I’ve lived here my entire 20 years and it took me this long lol. Anyways, I’ve rambled enough, I’m going to bed!
