Feel like I donâ€™t want to hang out with my friends anymore
I started to have free time and found some hobby I like. My friends usually want to hang out and eat, or going somewhere far to eat. I found that in my free time I would much rather do my hobby than hanging out with my friends. Is this what happens to every adult?
