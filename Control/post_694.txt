Looking for some old school music suggestions
Something like Dancing in the Moonlight by King Harvest or Brandy by Looking Glass. Just something fun to listen to while out for walks. I love that funk-feel those kind of artist put into their music. If there’s anything new like that I’d love to hear about it, too!
