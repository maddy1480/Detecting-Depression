I'm watching Fringe right now. Anyone remember this show when it was new?
I watched it shortly after it came out, I remember getting some of the DVDs from the library and some from a local pawn shop. I just found out it's streaming on HBO and it's a big nostalgia hit for me. I'm really enjoying it.

I watched the X-Files for the first time via some other streaming service a few years ago, and kinda forgot about Fringe. Now, re-watching Fringe, I *totally* see the parallels to the X-Files that people were talking about when it came out.

Funny how JJ Abrams became such a big name. And Tarkov (was that her name? Actress who played Olivia) didn't do much since then. Though she was in Last of Us! What a fox!
