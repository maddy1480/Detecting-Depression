Is there a word to describe hating something yet continuing to do it anyways?
I feel like there has to be whether real or in the dictionary of obscure sorrows. I need something to label the emotions that I feel whenever I sit down and play one video game in particular. Also if you know this feeling and don't mind sharing, what makes you feel this way?

If not, at least I'll always know I'm exactly like the otter that looks very angry as they eat a watermelon but still eat it anyways. Bless you if you know that meme.
