I'm a vegetarian but sometimes I break the rules and have a little meat.
Hey guys, hear me out on this one.

I identify as a vegetarian because I choose not to eat meat, but every now and then, I'll eat some leftover meat from my family's meals because I hate wasting food. It might be chicken, a burger, or a sausage.

So here's the question: Am I still a true vegetarian, or am I a hypocrite?

Let me know your thoughts.
