Any tips on how to stop procrastinating?
I have to write a script for my graduation film (I'm a film student), and I keep thinking that while it's all in my head it could still be good, but as soon as I start writing it it could become really bad, so I keep procrastinating.

I know this is a really stupid way of thinking but while I procrastinate some more I was wondering if any of you had any tips on how to start getting the job done?

Thank you!
