I just got my first client for the month!
Just yesterday, I shared my difficulty of getting jobs and clients who appreciated the value I was offering and today, I got a dm from a small business owner asking about how I could help her convert her reach to  customers on Instagram.

She had loads of reach and impressions but no sale or follower, and I told her it's because her page was not optimized, therefore it was hard for new people to trust her, she was glad I understood her plight and she further asked if I could help her out with it.

She was thrilled with my insights and grateful for my help. In the end, she became my first client this April, and I couldn't be happier. I knew that by helping her discover what her problem was and finding a solution that worked for her, I had made a real difference in her life. 

Congratulations on my success! Cheers!
