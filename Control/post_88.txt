The "oops" little things at work that make you smile?
I'm just writing this because I was in the bathroom earlier today, brushing my teeth after lunch, and somebody was filming the newest season of The Walking Dead in the toilet at the same time.  This person wound up to be one of my direct bosses.  That person came out of the toilet, went right for the door, but this a "oops" u-turn and washed their hands...but not before opening the washroom door beforehand.


That brought me a much-needed chuckle today, because that tells me full-well those hands usually do not get washed *(which was suspected for a long time)*.   It also tells that the position you hold within a company and your personal wealth does not buy you basic hygiene habits either.

...but that might be just me being jaded at work and creating this topic for a distraction.


Which  "oops"  behavior in the workplace have you seen that brighten up  (or ruined) your day?
