I feel like as a kid/teenager I didn't appreciate trees very much, now as an adult I think they're amazing and relaxing
As a kid/teenager I don't think I acknowledged trees that much at all and could've seen them as nothing special and just there but gosh I've noticed myself just randomly looking at them sometimes and truly appreciating how amazing and relaxing they are.

Watching them just blowing in the wind especially in a lovely sunny day can definitely relax my soul even if its for a few seconds. Now and then I've thought about how incredibly dystopian and bland the world would be without all of the trees everywhere... that thought makes me appreciate them so very much now.
