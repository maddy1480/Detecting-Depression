Should I take this job?
Hi Reddit—

I’m looking for a bit of advice. I just received an offer for a job working on an agent’s desk at an artists agency. The pay is fine, although I would have to work overtime each week in order to make sure I’m earning a livable wage for my city.

I left another corporate job in January after two years of working there — it was also in arts administration, though it was working in marketing for a publisher, so I imagine this potential role will be really different day-to-day. Possibly more stressful? Not sure.

The main rub is that I left the other job earlier this year to pursue the arts myself. At the end of the day, I’d like to be represented BY an agency, rather than work for one. But I have more years of work to put in, I think, before I get to the point of having representation. The desk I would be working on is in the area I’m most interested in working in in the future.

Right now, I work three part time jobs to make ends meet. It’s attractive to me to be able to collapse that down to only worrying about one job, although it will be a much more intense single job than any of the part time jobs I work. One of the people I work for now has a book coming out soon and might need support through that launch, so I’m thinking that if I do take the agency job, I could negotiate the start date to be after his book launches.

What do you guys think? Should I take the job? Or what should I be asking myself to know if I should take it? Thank you!
