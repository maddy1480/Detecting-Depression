Economy class flights need regulations to establish X number of seats per square foot, and the current number should be lowered.
I think its a violation of human rights having to sit in certain airline's economy seats for over two hours. Some airlines (I think CanadaAir) have fine economy seating, but recently I was on a Frontier flight where I literally could not move without touching the person next to me. Couldn't even take my personal item up from under the seat in front of me because of how close the seats are together. I'm not necessarily big or tall either. I have very broad shoulders that I have to tuck together like I have CCD.

Furthermore, you cannot sleep without laying your head onto the seat in front of you, that is seemingly made out of barbed wire, unless you brought a pillow with you that you will now have to haul around until you get back home/to your destination. Now luckily you have headphones or earbuds, because someone WILL bring their 6 month old child and they WILL scream the entire flight. This is the reward you get after sitting in checked baggage lines and TSA lines, and depending on your airport, can easily combine into a 90 minute ordeal. And don't even get me started on TSA.

I think corporate greed is growing out of control. The number of seats per plane increases while the size of the plane itself stays the same. All to encourage you to drop an extra $200-400 bucks to upgrade to business for slightly better seats.
