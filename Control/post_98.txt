Do you guys ever just tear up at the thought of your friends?
I was driving after getting some lunch today during my break at work, and I just thought about my friends. I thought about how goofy, kind, and loving every one of them are, and how fortunate I am to have them in my life. I started to tear up. I remember when we were kids, and how we all struggled in our own ways, but found solace in each other. I genuinely love them all, they're my chosen family. People who don't have any true "ties" to you, but stay in your life because they WANT to.
I'm just really grateful.
