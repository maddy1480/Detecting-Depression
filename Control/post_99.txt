Motivation needed...
I don't know wbere else to go for this, so here we go. I apologize if this is the wring place.

I had it pointed out to me that I'm "getting fat" and its just killed what little self esteem I had. I know I put a few pounds on, and this person also knows my weight is a touchy subject as I used to weigh nearly 500 pounds. I'm currently about 155 and most of that is due to new medications. 

I just need a little motivation, maybe positive advice and maybe some low impact work out suggestions.
