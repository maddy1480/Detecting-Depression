Deleted my dating apps!
I (23f) have deleted my dating apps, I have done this multiple times and ended up re downloading them like 3 weeks later, but hoping this time will be different (have even made an online journal on insta following every day of being single, to keep myself accountable since I have the willpower of a plank of wood lol) 

I’ve been feeling very jaded about modern dating, I hate being so superficial and rejecting people straight out for their looks. I hate how dating is now like a game of who can show they care less about the other person, and I hate being treated like I’m a disposable item.

I also just feel like I’ve got a lot of growing and working on myself to do and that the guy who is someone I will end up with shouldn’t be with someone who can’t let herself be loved, or is just generally feeling so so lost and confused. I’m 23 and I really shouldn’t be feeling like I’m gonna be alone forever haha.

I want to aim to go 3 months at the bare minimum (a year ideally) without dating apps/dating so I can figure out what I want/need from a partner and learn how to develop boundaries and a better relationship with myself.

Felt a bit bad deleting since I was in the middle of some convos but knew I had to strike while I was feeling the urge to change.

Just wanted to put it out there so if I’m caught posting another, is it ok he’s gone 3 weeks without texting me post I can be internet slapped!

Wish me luck :)
