Any ideas on how my nephew can earn money from overseas?
Hope everyones havin a good Tuesday! I have an 11yo nephew who is saving for a new PC. He mows lawns for $20 every fortnight/monthly, but is looking for more opportunities to earn more money. I'm happy to give him money, but I want him to earn it. However, I can't even think of how that can be done when he's thousands of km's away.

Speaking honestly, I'm fine with transferring my nephew $5 a week into his savings account anyway...but I think it's better if he earns it. Am I wrong? I'm not a parent so I have no idea lol. Would love ideas though from the more experienced or creative?
