kids and sweets
I'm in the middle of reading a korean comic, when in the story this kid pleads for something in exchange for her last chocolate (reluctantly, but determinedly).

this got me thinking, is it really that kids love sweets for some reason even with no conditioning needed, or is that we often give kids sweets and that's how kids get to love them. like, if you give your kid potato chips more often then maybe the kid will like salty snacks more than sweet snacks. what do you guys think?
