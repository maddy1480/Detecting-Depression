Playing pool
Well was at a hotel and a dude invited me to play pool with him I had a great time I had to leave the game early to catch a morning flight. We had a nice conversation and eventually parted ways and I am sure I am not going to see him again but I wish him well. Donâ€™t ever be shy to meet new people has given me good experiences and good stories as well haha
