Something I learned in therapy
The anxious voice in my head telling me to gun for the finish line as fast as I can does nothing except (1) paralyze me from doing the important things and (2) make me frantically search for a quick-fix solutions to distract from it. 

It means well, it truly does, but the pressure is debilitating. Life may be too short for gradual progress, but itâ€™s also too short to be fueled by perpetual fear. 

I choose to go at my own pace. 

Grateful to have confronted and released some of my age anxiety today, and I hope this will resonate with some of you.
