Music is almost like a drug, it has a GIGANTIC effect on my cognition.
It's crazy how much music can affect your thinking and by extension your entire life.

In college I had sort of an inkling of this. I had a specially curated "Lift" playlist for working out, and I specifically picked angry and motivating songs that would help me power through the workout. I was consciously picking songs that would alter my mood in such a way that would be more effective at working out, and I always swore to people that the right song would make you 25% stronger when lifting weights.

Recently I had the idea to make a "Neutral" playlist of music. By Neutral I mean only songs with unemotional, basic, non-diatonic songs, songs that specifically are chosen to NOT elicit emotions in me. If I find myself feeling any negative emotions while listening to a song, it's out. WOW. I had no idea that taking such a simple step of making a playlist would change my life so much. By just having a constant mix of "neutral" music on in the background, I have found myself with more energy, a more positive mood, less negative thoughts, and more motivation to work on projects. For YEARS I have struggled with motivation and positive thinking. Who would have thought that simply changing the noises in my life could have such a huge effect?

Now granted, time will tell whether my "Neutral" playlist keeps working. But I can tell you that my "Lift" playlist never lost its potency, so I'm hopeful.

Does anyone else have any experiences with this phenomenon, or advice on other sorts of "specialty playlists" one could develop?
