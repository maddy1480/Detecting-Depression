How to do a hill start on an automatic car? 

I get kinda scared when the car rolls backwards a bit. And I kinda press the gas too much and we’ll we start going faster. But ik it’s wrong and I should do it slower but seriously I don’t know how to do it without feeling like my heart is gonna come out of my chest.
