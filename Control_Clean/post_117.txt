Knowing about pregnancy
Disclaimer: Im only interested in stories of people, not seeking a medical knowledge!

Dear AFAB people or people with intimite knowledge of AFAB people,

Did you know about your pregnancy quickly, like few days after it happened? I always hear how you don't know about pregnancy until a month or two, so Im interested in opposite cases. Was the first sign the nausea or something else?
