Does anyone else sometimes have weird spatial experiences before falling asleep?
I guess „spatial experiences“ sounds odd but I don’t know how to describe it. 

Sometimes when I close my eyes and lay in bed before falling asleep, I get this feeling that my surroundings are getting smaller and smaller while also spinning.

Say I’m laying there, eyes closed, my face is in the direction of my nightstand and I would see that nightstand if I opened my eyes. Suddenly this feeling starts that the nightstands moves further and further away from me (or I further away from it). Everything gets smaller and smaller as it moves away, sometimes it feels like I’m spinning too. 

As soon as I open my eyes it stops. I can snap out of it any time. 

It sounds kinda unpleasant but it really isn’t. It’s not particularly pleasant or anything, it’s just an odd feeling. I remember it from being a kid, where I experienced this every single time I had a fewer. It’s gotten more rare now (I’m in my mid 20s) but sometimes it still happens.

Has anyone experienced anything similar? Is there maybe a name for it?
