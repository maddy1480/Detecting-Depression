which country of the world would you want to have friends in?
as a child ive always wanted to have friends all over the world and the idea still seems very nice to me, so i started wonderng about other people. what about you? is there a place you'd like to visit already having friends there?

ive always wanted to know people from asia because the country's dynamics and culture are very different than mine, so i alway got curious about how would it be.
