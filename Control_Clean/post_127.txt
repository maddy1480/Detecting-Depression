Is it normal to feel out of place at concerts?
I go to concerts every few months from small, intimate music halls to big outdoor amphitheaters. I almost always enjoy and appreciate the music, but I always feel like I am not able to let loose and dance/sing like everyone around me (I feel like an idiot when I dance). If I stand there quietly and enjoy the music, I feel like a weirdo. I’m just curious if this is a normal anxiety or something I’ve totally manufactured in my own head.
