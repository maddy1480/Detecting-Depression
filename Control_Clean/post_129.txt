Is it normal to feel weird as taste changes?
As I’m maturing and my music taste is changing I just wanted to ask if anyone else felt apprehensive or just off by changing tastes? Like I still enjoy the music I listened to previously but it’s not my favorite genre anymore or maybe this was caused by a deeper thing like maybe my identity was being a fan of that music?
