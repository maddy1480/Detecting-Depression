Turning my life around and following through with it.
I guess I’m posting here for that final push. My life up until the last maybe year of my life has been pretty turbulent. My father died when I was in college which kicked off years and years of mental health problems. Multiple suicide attempts, hospital trips, therapy. Anyway, it’s taken me a long time to get to a point in my life where I feel ready to really sort my life out. I have a wonderful fiancé, I got fit, started eating healthier and lost weight, I love to be outside and go hiking and camping. The one thing I struggled the most with though was career. I couldn’t stick in a job for more than a few months without having a mental breakdown so I completely shut my self away from even trying to get a job or trying to achieve something. Fast forward to now and I’ve sent my application to work in an animal care program. I’ve got the money together for a yachting course in late June and a scuba diving certification course. I also have been training to climb the three British peaks which I begin on the 4th of June. I’ve also found an all female Brazilian jiu jitsu class near me which I’ve enquired about. Basically, I’m pretty close to achieving the things I want to do but it’s taking that final step and actually paying for and booking these courses. I’m so so excited about it all but I’m also extremely nervous about it. I’ve never really taken a leap like this and it’s very different from how my life was. I hope I’m doing the right thing for myself.
