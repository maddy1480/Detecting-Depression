Opinions on two job offers?
Hey all, my spouse and I are at a standstill. Could use some outside opinions. My spouse has two job offers currently, one at Kaiser for a part-time call center, the other a full time position for an elderly care facility in management. 

The Kaiser pros are the wonderful health care benefits, that would cover my spouse, child, and myself. It’s also a large corporation and union, so there is opportunity for growth within. The negatives are that the position is part time, with weekly changing schedules, and it pays a few dollars less than the other

The elder facility pros are it pays more, and is steady work that guarantees our bills are covered. The negatives are that there is no room for promotion or advancement, so there is no long term growth potential, and the health care is just ok, and doesn’t cover the spouse, just the child. 

We can make both work, with hustling on Instacart/Uber on the side. With Kaiser that will be a must. With the other it is an option. 

Any ideas? Anyone know anything about advancing at Kaiser? We don’t have degrees so that’s a shot in the foot.
