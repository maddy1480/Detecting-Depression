Something pleasant you witnessed recently
I find it difficult to talk positively and that gets in the way of making friends. It's hard for me to say something good about my day, even if it was decent (see what I did there?). 

I just wanted a safe space to practice, feel free to join me!

I'll start by saying that I am really happy to have had both Monday and Friday off, I got 2 weekends in one week and was able to both relax and catch up on personal things. I enjoyed spending time in a nice library with some nice people. After being able to think clearly, I got my dusty rollerblades out of the closet and got excited about spring.

Phew, that wasn't so bad! Thank you for listening, Reddit. Have a good day.
