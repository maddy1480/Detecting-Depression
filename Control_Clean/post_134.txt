A school bully 40+ years later
**This is a story from the internet.**

*The original was written in another language, I translated the story. Grammatics of that language allows to understand the author of the story is a man.*

"I met my former classmate on the street. We recognized each other, said hello and shook hands. And right after that (he\`s taller than me) he spat on my head and laughed like a moron. Like when we were kids... He was a school bully and constantly bullied me. 

I got confused and just said him "You\`re asshole" and leaved quickly.

We\`re 60 years old. Maybe, he is a person with early dementia... And my blood pressure monitor is showing 160\*110 now, I\`m taking medicine."
