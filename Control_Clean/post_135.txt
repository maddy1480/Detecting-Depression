I hate when people can’t make decisions and asking me what I think about every little thing
For as long as I can remember my mom has always had a really hard time making decisions. I don’t mean big ones, but things like produce at the store. She’ll spend 5 minutes examining a bag of avocados, ask me which one is better to which I randomly choose one because I CANNOT tell the difference, and then she tells me that actually she thinks the other one is better. 

She also likes shopping which I hate and constantly brings home new pieces of clothing then tries them on and asks me which one looks better (she often buys multiple copies of the same item just in case something fits better). The thing is it all looks the same to me? She can spend an hour changing and asking me what looks better and if I can tell which one she’s wearing now. No mom, I can’t. 

She’s incapable of making a decision without someone’s validation or input and I feel like such a bad person for saying this but I genuinely can’t stand people who do this. Even my grandma agrees and says she kind of goes overboard with it sometimes. Maybe it’s cause I’m very independent when it comes to my own decision making idk. I’m practically the opposite of her, I never ask other people for opinions.
