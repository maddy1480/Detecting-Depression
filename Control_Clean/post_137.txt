Found a new hobby that I actually enjoy!
During the pandemic, I've tried things like embroidery, painting, and even playing a lyre harp, but none of them stuck with me. But last month, I noticed a bird outside my classroom window, and I was absolutely fascinated by how its tail moved like a fan! I did a Google search and found out the bird was a Pied Fantail, a common bird in my area. This encounter made me constantly look out my seat window (my classroom is located on the third floor) to observe the branches, waiting for any kind of bird to perch for even a moment. And so far, I've seen about 10 different bird species through that window! All of them might be considered "common birds," but that doesn't stop me from getting any less excited.
