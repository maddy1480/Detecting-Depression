I've got a night of karaoke coming up and it'll be my seconding time doing it; what are some recommendations for unusual and/or ridiculous songs I could do?
TNT by AC/DC is one I've decided to do (Bon Scott is about to roll hard in his grave RIP) and I want some others that might make me look like an even bigger tit. Who knows, I may just walk away with a list of recommendations that'll see me through the rest of my karaoke-ing days... And maybe all of you will too ðŸ¤˜
