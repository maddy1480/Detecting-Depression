Going back to school soon, I miss project work, assignments and lectures.
I'm not really mature in my early 20s, I was hopping from job to job and just couldn't settle down and commit to something. And to top it off, my mental state was in a rough shape and I spent some months as a shut in. I enrolled into a local CS program, which I paid for myself, and things were going well initially before I fell into truancy. Retook a module, failed another and barely passed a bunch of others. I then made the dumb decision to withdraw from the program.

Now, it's been almost a year since I was out, I was still working part time jobs while interviewing for software engineering jobs. Things were going great, had a bunch of interviews but things took a turn for the worse with the market and opportunities became scarce and one company which I passed the interview bar froze hiring. I was left with nothing, who wants someone with just an associates.

I have since took a test engineer role, which involves zero coding, and applied to enroll back into to complete the CS program in a part time capacity. Honestly the market is rough, but I'm also asking for it by trying to jump the gun with an incomplete degree. Now I'm just waiting for classes to start next quarter.

If I was matured enough and completed the program in one sitting things might've turned out differently, but that's in the past. My focus now is work full time and take on studies part time, this time round I will attend all lectures dutifully and complete all assignments way before deadline. I had fun during school times and I can't wait to experience it all over again.
