Firing someone for the first time tomorrow in my career. Wondering what your tips are.
I like him as a person, but he sucks at his job. Hit our breaking point. But I’ve never got to actually fire someone before. For context we’re a small company (20-40) and he’s been given lots and lots of opportunity to turn it around. I’ll have my HR director with me to CYA. Wondering what you know works well or not at all?
