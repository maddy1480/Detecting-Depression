How did you know what you want to do in life?
I(15m) am a freshman. Honestly it scares the crap out of me. It's also really fun as well for me. I can't decide what I want to be in life because there's so many things that interest me but I don't know how to tell which one is "the one" for me. I'm gonna try to double major when I'm older because I believe that I am strong enough mentally to do it. College isn't really that interesting to me honestly because of debt, but I'm willing to go through with it if it's a requirement in whatever career I choose. Mainly my point of this question how did you decide which career(s) were for you/were the one(s)?
