I want to go outside, but there's nothing for me to do. What should I do?
Just kinda bored and tired, it's sunny outside and I want to go outside but there's nothing for me to do outside. All of my friends are busy, so I can't hang out with them. I have the social skills of an avocado and get really nervous around other people so I can't go to social events or gatherings.
