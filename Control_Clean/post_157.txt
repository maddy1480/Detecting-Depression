I booked myself a trip
It’s just two nights in a hotel, about 50 miles away. I’m going for no reason other than to stay in a hotel. A nice change of scenery. A bit of a reset. I’m in my late 20s, no kids, single, etc. but I feel all I do is wake up, do my morning routine, go to work and give 110%, come home and do my evening routine, sleep. Rinse and repeat. And that’s fine! I enjoy the work I do, I also really enjoy coming home and being able to decompress and let the social mask fall, as it were. I’ve got a week off coming up soon, and typically I don’t make any set in stone plans for my “vacations”. It’s just… time I won’t be at work lol. But I’ve never done anything like this before, and booked the room before I really even had time to think about it. I’m very excited and while I have shared my plans with a few friends and my mom, I guess I also just wanted to share with a bunch of internet strangers! Also I suppose maybe looking for suggestions by way of snacks. What should I bring to snack on for two days/nights?! I plan on not really leaving the hotel room, except for the killer breakfast spread they have. Anyways. Sorry for the ramblings. I’m just equal parts pumped and also nervous!!
