Press "Shuffle" on your music playlist. What are the first three songs that come up?
My music is becoming increasingly boring. I actually just made a reddit account just to ask this question; I'll give it a spin too.

1. How I Am - Aaron May, JAY Millz
2. Heat - 50 Cent
3. Good Things Fall Apart - ILLENIUM, Jon Bellion
