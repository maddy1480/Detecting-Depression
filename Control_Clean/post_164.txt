My puppy got scared of my bf and peed and pooped
So basically earlier my bf met my puppy. My puppy is still trying to get used of other people and she got scared of my bf to the point where she peed and pooped on the floor as I carried her. She pees from excitement when my dad comes home from work since in her eyes heâ€™s the favorite. So yea. My puppy is 7 months old also.
