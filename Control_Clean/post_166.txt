Almost killed someone on the road and got a thumbs up
Was on a two lane section of a huge bridge, going 80kmph, had the signal on for about a second to overtake the guy in front. Just a fraction of the second before I made my lane switch, a motorcycle appeared out of nowhere just zoomed past us both. Mind you this was a car-only set of lanes, speed limit was 80 while he was going at least 120 by the look of it, and he made no attempt to make himself known, like no blinking no honking. If I reacted just a fraction of second slower it would get bad. At least a dozen people die on that bridge every year, all motorcyclers on the car only lanes (yeah I did some research afterwards). Kicker is, as he zoomed past, he gave me (and the other car?) a thumbs up. Iâ€™m not sure how to feel about it. Anyone got a similar experience?
