Some new lyrics, feel free to add some tunes. Too Social
Verse 1:
Scrolling down my feed, it's all so fake
Perfect lives and bodies, it's hard to take
TikTok dances and Instagram models
Likes and followers, they're all just hollow

Chorus:
Tik and toks and what the fucks
Instagram and Facebook have turned to sluts
We're all just chasing after fame
But what's left when we're all the same?

Verse 2:
Filters and hashtags, it's all a game
We're living for the likes, it's such a shame
Facebook posts and Instagram stories
We're all just seeking fleeting glories

Chorus:
Tik and toks and what the fucks
Instagram and Facebook have turned to sluts
We're all just chasing after fame
But what's left when we're all the same?

Bridge:
Let's break free from this endless scroll
Find our own path, and take control
We're more than just a profiles cage
Let's live our lives, and turn the page

Chorus:
Tik and toks and what the fucks
Instagram and Facebook have turned to sluts
We're all just chasing after fame
But what's left when we're all the same?

Outro:
Tik and toks and what the fucks
Let's put down our phones, and find our strut
We're more than just a number or a like
Let's live our lives, and shine our light.
