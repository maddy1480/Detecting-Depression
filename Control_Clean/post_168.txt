I think I'm finally pushing for my life
Just for context, I'm a 24year old young lady. Might not matter, but someone might get my point
My parents have kept me at home for getting to 3years now. No work, no school, nothing. 
I'm not allowed to stay out with friends, not allowed to be on my phone past 11pm... Again, I'm 24
So I decided to take a drastic decision and move out of the house. My dad is the type to always put down ideas that he doesn't like or that doesn't suit him. I asked him for capital to start a business, but that one was turned down too
I know they're gonna go through all stages of grief when I move out, but I feel like it's long overdue.
