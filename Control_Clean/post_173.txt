What is your first world problem right now?
 I need to level up my character in Elden RIng and, to do so, I went to a pretty popular rune farming spot and as always I do I was planning to listen to something other than the in-game music. The thing I chose to entertain me whilst I do such a tedious but (at least for me )fun task was to listen to the Spain Euro 2012 matches for no particular reason, just because, until I got fed up. But I discovered that the only available match with the spanish commentary that I could find was the first one, uploaded by some random channel to YT. And this, I wouldn't say that got me mad or something but I'm kind of bothered because I don't understand why , as spaniard, I can't go to the state funded television (RTVE) webpage to watch the football matches of my national team whenever I want. I can understand if it was La Liga because it's a private organization or whatever, but I think that any match or sports competition in which participate athletes representing their national team (obviously, I'm not talking only about Spain but also every other country) are a cultural interest asset that should be available for everyone to see without restrictions
