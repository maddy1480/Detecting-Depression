Other people are just humans like me and you.
I been thinking and i just realized we have this culture where we don't talk to random people when outside but if it's the internet everyone talks to everyone and even treats strangers bad.

i would like to know why this is? was there a culture where everyone talked to everyone? let's imagine i go to the bus and sit there, normally from what i see people just talk to the people they already know, what is this thing of "strangers" aren't we all human?

off course, i act as everyone else does and i don't go out there talking to random people, just good morning etc...

but yesterday i was really drunk and just spoke to everyone and i could really feel that everyone is a human and likes a handshake a little bit of talk, some more others less but why don't we talk to everyone?
