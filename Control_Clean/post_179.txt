Some kid out there has no idea their whole life is a lie
I was fishing one time at a state park not far from where I grew up. I caught a largemouth and was getting ready to throw it back it when this younger man politely asked me if I could keep it on the hook and gently toss it back in instead. 

He told me that his daughter was on her way to the park and he wanted her to “catch her first fish.” I didn’t see any harm in it and agreed. She arrived no more than a couple minutes later. 

He let some line out and handed her the pole. About a minute later she started to scream with excitement and yelled, “I got a fishy!” 

She reeled it in, took a picture and her dad released it back into the water. Her parents were so grateful that I honestly thought they were gonna cry. Pretty harmless lie, but I wonder if they ever ended up telling her the truth haha.
