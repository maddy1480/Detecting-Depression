When do people who work full time go to the gym?
I have been retired for almost nine years. I've worked part time since I retired, but now I've gone back full time. I work from home.

My only problem with that is I can't figure out when to go to the gym!  I am not a morning person, and by the time I get off work, I feel too drained.  I still walk on my own treadmill sometime during the day, but I haven't been to the gym in two weeks, so I'm not getting any strength training except squats.

If you work full time and still get to the gym, when do you go?  How do you work it in?
