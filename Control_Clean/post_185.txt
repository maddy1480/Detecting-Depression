I'm soo bored..
I've been indoors since Wednesday cause i suddenly fell sick. I have literally no one to talk to because my friends mostly come online at night( i only have two friends ðŸ¤§welp); i honestly don't know why and i can't stay up late because of my medication . It's just so exhausting staying in bed all day and scrolling through my phone and i can't do any physical activity because I feel weak. I'm also new here so i hope to  at least get someone to talk to.
Thanks
