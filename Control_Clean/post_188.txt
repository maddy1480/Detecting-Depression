Forklift Drivers are Awesome!
I’m amazed at how the forklift drivers at my workplace remember where they store everything. There are thousands of skids of materials and partially-processed products, and they can find what they want within minutes!

They are also good at keeping an eye on the multiple workstations in my area of the plant, and getting material to us when we need them. Often, they drop the skids of material *before* we need them.

Not to mention that some drivers can actually pick up a coin with a forklift fork. 

If you also admire forklift drivers, why? I would also love to hear about cool things you’ve seen forklift drivers do.
