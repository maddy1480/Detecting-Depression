What series helped you to improve your social skills?
The question may seem weird but for example modern family, to me is by far the best example of good parenting, learning and growing together. 

I wonder if there is any series that can become a good example for me to act in social situations if that makes sense. I lack social skills and have difficulty holding a conversation for more than a minute. I am good with ‘professional communication’ but have a hard time making new friends and might also come of as un-approachable at times. So looking for anything that helps.
