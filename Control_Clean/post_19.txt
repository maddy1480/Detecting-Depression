I throw my brush hair out my window for birds to use as nesting material
From probably about mid-March to late August (no specific dates) I will clean my brush by ripping out the hair and throwing it out my ground floor window into the bushes so birds can use it as nesting material. I've never seen a bird take it and I have no evidence that this actually works, but hair is biodegradable and is supposedly great nesting material. I have long hair so I need to clean my brush more often than most and I'd like to think that birds all over my area are finding my hair clumps and having the best day ever building homes for their little spring families.
