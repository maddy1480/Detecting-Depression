Why do people post "prove me wrong" type of posts on Reddit?
I see this a lot. People say something they seem to believe in and add "prove me wrong" in the end. Instead of a thoughtful discussion, they ask for an argument. I don't remember seeing this sort of thing on other social media sites. Is this a Reddit culture thing? 

This account is young but I've actually been on Reddit for many years. So, I've seen a lot of "prove me wrong" type of posts. (My old account glitched. I made this new one to join conversations. Got the old account working but decided to stay on this one for a while. Kind of really liking this sub.)
