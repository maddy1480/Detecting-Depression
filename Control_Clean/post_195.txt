Finally done for the evening.
My husband informed me before he left work today that his parents are coming over tomorrow. I did not get the house as clean as I would have liked, but I'm not embarrassed for my mother in law to see it. 

My living room is sort of like a storage facility right now because I'm letting my friend store some stuff while he's in the middle of a move. My poor husband can't do a lot to help around the house, he's trying to pass kidney stones. 

So, my kid and I put the house back together. Luckily, we didn't have to do a lot, since the 3 of us aren't that messy. 

I really wish they would give us a little bit more notice, like more than 18 hour notice. lol, It's just annoying. I'm 44 years old and still worried about his momma being happy with the way our house looks. This woman has been my mother in law since 1996 and I still worry about her opinion.
