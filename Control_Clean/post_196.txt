Has anyone experienced bad luck or ill health caused by their home?
Sounds a bit strange, but I'm curious if anyone has experience something like this or if it's all in my head. I know it's normal to have spurts of bad luck and ill health, however when it's one thing after another non-stop without a break, it starts feeling a bit exhausting.
