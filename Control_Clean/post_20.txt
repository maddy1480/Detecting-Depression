The mystery of sleep paralysis
I don’t know how many have experienced but its such a scary thing to happen to anyone. I used to experience this a lot when i was younger and it’s usually accompanied by a nightmare, the feeling of not being able to move any part of your body is such a terrifying one. I know in some cultures its been linked with demonic attacks and all but a quick research shows that it might actually be scientific, however its still very scary. Lemme know, have you had any experience? And how was it?
