What's a good day trip / activity to do with my dad?
Hey.  I'm 18/19, dad is in his 50s.  I'm wanting to do a day trip or some sort of activity with him this weekend.  Would appreciate some suggestions.

What I've been thinking is to drive out to a provincial park (we're in Toronto) and walk/hike around.  Maybe try to find a good restaurant in a small town somewhere nearby.

But I'm really not sure and would appreciate if you all could share some other options.

Thanks.
