All alone and not feeling too great…

Just like the title says I’m home by myself today and am just feeling pretty bummed out. Could use some conversation to keep me company (and maybe boost morale), so let’s talk! Give me your most controversial food opinions. Here’s mine: I hate leftovers and will strategically try & only make enough for one meal :)
