I wish I was a deer sniffing flowers in the forest and watching my antlers grow and fall and grow again.
Life is all based on luck eh guys? Some of us born as frogs , some of us born as deers and others like us born as humans. And even within humans different ethnicities , different economic backgrounds, different genetic conditions, different expectations. I wonder if there was a galaxical roll of a die that made me me. And what would I have been if the die landed another side. Goodnight fellow humans.
