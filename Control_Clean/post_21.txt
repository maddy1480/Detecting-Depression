I’m not sure what this is called but can anyone relate?
As long as I can remember, there’s been often third person flashes where I haven’t seen myself as me… if that makes any sense. 

From daily interactions with others to any task,
There’s a chance I get intrusive images of me as a character.

It started as a young kid with any film I’d been obsessing over. For example, I could be talking to a friend and in my mind I’m Aragorn from lord of the rings. 

It’s hard to find the words that truly explain what I’m trying to say but bear with me. I’d say I have a very vivid and imaginative mind, struggling with intrusive thoughts doesn’t help too. I’ve struggled with body image and my weight for most of my life, so I wouldn’t be surprised if it has some involvement.

Coming across the “adopting character’s personality meme” helped me see this is pretty common however for me it stretches beyond film or tv. Any musician I’m into, I subconsciously picture myself as them.

I guess it’s a form of escapism my mind creates to cope. 

What is this called?
