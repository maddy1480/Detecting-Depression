People who have always been Alone do you ever feel lonely ?
I'm asking this because I never felt I would need anyone in my life but, had this short companionship, and after that now I do feel I need someone in my life

So I wonder, people who never had been in any type of companionship or always been alone by choice, do they ever feel lonely or need for companionship or content as they are ?
