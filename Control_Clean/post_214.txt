As I get older the more I find I dislike change more and more
I don't hate change completely but I do fully live by the adage of if it aint broke don't fix it. I feel like if something works it works don't questiont it don't try to change just accept it and move on. I don't understand why some people have to over analyze and put labels on everything. Feels like everything is just moving so fast and I just want time to stop for a moment. Anybody else feel like that?
