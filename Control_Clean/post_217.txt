I'm going to be a Dad by next weekend!!!
The countdown has begun! We had our 38 week appointment yesterday, and the Dr told us to get scheduled for an induction next Wednesday! 

This is our first child (a girl) and while the overall pregnancy flew by, these last few weeks have been like watching a pot boil... It seemed like she was going to come late if anything, so even though it's only a few days before the due date it still feels "early" for some reason... 

My brother and I were born at 24 weeks (2lbs combined) so seeing her on all the scans and knowing that we have a strong healthy girl about to come into the world just has me over the moon. 

I can't wait to meet her, and the house has been ready for weeks, but for whatever reason hearing the words "scheduled for induction" just made me have this instant feeling of "Holy crap we have so much stuff to still get done." even though we don't. 

Any parents here do you have any last minute advice? Any advice on raising a girl in particular? What was your experience like? 

It still feels crazy... But now it just feels so so REAL.. Like by next weekend, I'm going to be a Dad. Like walking around the house next weekend there's going to be a baby here. I'm excited. I'm nervous. I'm happy beyond belief. She's everything we could've dreamed of and more.
