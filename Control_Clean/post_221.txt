after months of radio silence from employers, i feel like i just hit the jackpot on jobs
TL;DR at the end

i was the type of kid that just goofed off, partied, and didnt do jack shit in high school, and my grades reflected that (gpa: ~2.2 IIRC) and i never planned on going to college bc i never thought i could handle it, and i never had any professional passions/aspirations

fast forward to 2020 ive been graduated so im working but then the pandemic hits, i was in trade at the time and my company worked in hospitals so i “got laid off” (they finally reached back to me a few months ago, gee thanks…) so i decided “fuck it” and enrolled in community college. ive been continuing to take classes since, and ive been unemployed throughout this time

fast forward to about a year ago and i was invited to join Phi Theta Kappa, which is the international honors society for community college students. this was the first time in my life id been given an academic honor like this

i still dont feel like i really have an *incredibly* strong goal for my career (ive had a looong history of flip flopping) but ive been drawn towards the general idea of working with computers, and sometimes more specifically adobe software/graphic arts and picture/video editing

my graphic arts artstyle is pretty surreal/bold/non professional though and when i wasnt learning to use these softwares through making art it was through making memes, so i really dont have anything to show off my abilities to employers for that

because of my tendency to flip flop and my lack of a clear vision, i decided to just go for a general studies degree

i only have 1 class left until graduation and im currently in the middle of it, so ive been applying to basically any job thats not service/fast food and in several months time i was only able to land 1 potential interview, which fell through before we got to the in-person stage unfortunately

that was, until i started going through the process of getting hired by the people who actually hired me. 

i applied to be a entry level marketing consultant, and i already felt underqualified for that. BUT APPARENTLY THEY FELT DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE THEY HIRED ME AS A “MANAGER IN TRAINING”

#WHAT????

to be fair, i think the interview went incredibly well. turns out, the guy who was interviewing me (who i believe is going to be my boss) was really into using adobe software as a hobby as well! he said his artstyle was inspired by anime, and that he loves anime. i told him that i intend to continue to grow my skills with adobe as im with the company, whether inside or outside of work, as i intend to one day have a career relating to that, and he seemed to really like the idea.

##TL;DR:

never tried in high school and didnt plan on going to college -> leroy jenkins’d my way into community college after getting laid off bc of covid -> got invited to an honors society -> *unsuccessfully trying to apply for jobs despite total lack of career/education direction and 3 year work gap* -> applies to be an entry level marketing consultant -> gets hired to be manager in training instead

i am so incredibly underqualified for this position, and i cant wait to start
