My business is going under and I'm actually glad!
I've been running a vacant land business for about 2 years now. Basically, I buy vacant land, fix it up, install septic/utilities, and then sell it.

I got into this business by accident over the pandemic and it did well, so I continued it for the past 2 years. But lately, it started going under and I found myself glad. This business has been really stressful, and I've always wanted to do something different. But my dad taught me to take advantage of opportunities like this as you'll never know when you'll have another successful business. So I did and granted, he was somewhat right as I was able to save up money and get out of a bad financial situation. 

But now that it's going under I'm excited about what's next. I'm going to keep a piece of land for my self and build a tiny house! I also think I'm going to go back to school for teaching. 

Many would be sad because of their failing business but I'm proud of myself and I'm excited!
