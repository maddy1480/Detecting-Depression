is this is necessary to reflect a good man picture to prove that you are fit to the society
Discuss this topic plz
 I have my views on this...

I think we all have our problems in our life but society have a equal benchmark for all the people around .
Doesn't matter how they are spending their life , how they are dealing with the situations . It just you have to be happy you have to be sure about everything you are doing . 

I don't understand why society parameters are same for diversified population.....
