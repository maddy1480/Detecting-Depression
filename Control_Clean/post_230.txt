New to reddit and looking for tips
I just joined Reddit and I'm excited to explore all the different communities and content on here. However, I'm a bit overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information and don't really know where to start.

If any of you have any tips for getting started on Reddit, I would really appreciate it! Some specific questions I have are:

* What are some good subreddits to check out for someone who's interested in art, music, and travel?
* How do I upvote/downvote posts and comments?
* Is there anything I should know about the culture and etiquette of Reddit?

Thanks in advance for any advice you can offer! I'm looking forward to being a part of the Reddit community.

Thanks Veronica
