How good are you at reading people?
A guy sat near me at a study room asked me to keep an eye on his things for a bit and later thanked me, and with one look I understood he was interested. About an hour later he takes some mints out of his bag, gives one to a friend, and I just thought "oh, he's going to offer me one" and he did! I freaked a bit lol

I often read of people mistaking politeness with interest and sometimes I am afraid to do the same, so I avoid being too forward, but that never happened to me. At this point I guess I'm good at reading people's intentions

How good are you at catching the cues of someone being polite, interested or not wanting you around?
