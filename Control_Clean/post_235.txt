A regular at work
There’s this older guy that comes into my work and he’s really taken a liking to me- to the point where every time I see him (every day) he tell me he’s going to sing a song. 
Every time he doesn’t, but today, as soon as he approached me, I burst out in song and we had a good laugh about it. 
He promised me the next time he sees me he’ll sing me a song, but I really doubt he will. 
Sometimes I love working with the public, does anyone else have a regular they just seem to click with?
