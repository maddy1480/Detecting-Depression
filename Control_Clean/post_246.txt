I want to express how grateful I am to men who help me carry my luggages up and down stairs at train stations
I travel quite a lot and I end up with heavy luggages which I struggle to carry up and down the stairs at train platforms that may not have a lift service. 

On every single occasion, men turned up noticing me and asked me if I needed help. I am now standing on a platform waiting for my train. There were two men who helped me - one asked me if I needed help carrying my luggages up the stairs and then as I was preparing to go down the stairs, a man coming up asked me the same and then asked which one was the heaviest.
I am so grateful for this, you are awesome and so considerate and make my day everytime. Thank you.
