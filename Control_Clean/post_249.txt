Came home after a long day and found out water was leaking from the ceiling in my condo. Upstairs neighbor forgot to turn off their water. Anyone faced similar issues before? What do I need to do. I cant afford to move out anytime soon.

I turned off the electricity from the main circuit breaker and removed all the frozen food from my fridge.  Staying at a friends house because the water is still leaking.
