Thank you for inviting me!
As you can see from my terrible rating, I got off to a rocky start on Reddit last year.  I had a friend struggling with an attempted switch to Mint mobile and posted about it so that others could avoid the difficulties he encountered.  Somehow this made a "Mint Mobile Army" very upset! lol  Looking for a fresh start with friendly people to interact with and wishing you a great day!
