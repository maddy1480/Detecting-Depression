A question about void space.
There are vast regions of space where there does not seem to be any kind of massive body like a star or singularity or anything like that. My question is what is the shape of space in in a star void. Would flat space be flatter? Would space be somehow denser or lighter towards the center of a void? What about classical Einstein space? What would it do to the lines that stretch on into infinity and such?
