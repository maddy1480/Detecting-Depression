I’m a bit embarrassed when i get asked what i do for a living
So when people ask me what i do, i tell them I’m in the US Coast Guard, a lot of them get excited and ask me what my specific job is.. well, im a cook. 

No one ever tells me it’s lame to my face but i feel like they get disappointed when they find out I’m not jumping out of helicopters or saving lives. 

I love my job but sometimes i just feel like its a little lame from an outside perspective



Edit: i just want to thank everyone for the nice comments. Definitely got a different perspective of it. Thank you

Edit 2: read all 400+ comments and not a single negative one. Thank you guys
