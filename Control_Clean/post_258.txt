I clipped my fingernails for the first time in maybe 10+ years.
I’ve always had this bad habit of biting my fingernails ever since I was little, mainly due to anxiety. I got into this groove of not biting them all of last month and naturally, they actually grew. They were getting kind of long so this morning when I woke up, I clipped them all off! It’s very weird to be happy about something like this, but I’m proud of myself!
