Cake day :D
I was not having a great time today, and I just logged on to Reddit to see that it's my second cake day (the day has almost ended too lol). Even though it's not really something to celebrate, that meaningless milestone and the Reddit bot's use of exclamation marks and emojis made me a bit happier :D
