New Hobbies
Hello. So I've been in between jobs for a while now, it's been a little difficult to find a job so I've decided that I'd use this time to get into something new or find a new hobby. I'm not really sure what I'd like to get into. I love baking and crocheting so apart from those, what are some of your favourite hobbies? Fun, unconventional, weird, whichever, I just want to try something new.
