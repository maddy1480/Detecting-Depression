Paying with card at a restaurant is a very different experience in USA and Europe
Just a very interesting cultural difference I've encountered when I first visited USA.

How it works in Europe: you ask your server for a bill and tell them you'll pay with your card. They bring a terminal to your table, you use your card/phone/watch to pay and then you leave. (This happened in USA only once in the entire 2 weeks of my stay). In some countries it's a nice gesture to leave 10% in cash if the service was great.

USA: I was so shocked that they actually take your card away from you (I would call the police if someone tried to do that in Poland, I think most people here would). But that's not all. I had an embarrassing moment the first time I was eating in a restaurant in USA. After they took my card and brought it back to my table, I filled the receipt with the "tip" and "total" amounts (of course I was aware that tipping in USA is a very different story than in Europe and I respected that everywhere), and... waited for someone to take my card again to complete the payment, because I thought they need to do that in order to take the tip! It took several minutes of me exchanging awkward looks with my server before I called them and they explained that I don't need to do anything more and I can just leave at this point.

I got used to that in the 2 weeks that I spent in the US, but it was still a weird feeling when I had to loose contact with my card!
