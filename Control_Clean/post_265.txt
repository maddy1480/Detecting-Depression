i hate brushing my teeth
i hate brushing my teeth. i think its a sensory thing along with an allergy thing. sensory because i dont like how toothpaste keeps expanding in your mouth till you are a drooling dog. or that most people do it right after breakfest ruining the taste of a good meal. other than that i forget or avoid doing it. 
allergy wise im really allergic to mint (any kind of mint) so 90% toothpaste is not going to work for me. not unless i want my mouth really swollen. even if i go to buy the kids toothpaste almost all of it is mixed with mint. like strawberry mint. 
when i go to the dentist its bad too because they dont always keep track of whats mint. so lots of times i had to go home before they were done because my gums were swelling. 

just wondering how many other people hate brushing their teeth or have a mint allergy too. it would be nice to know im not alone in this
