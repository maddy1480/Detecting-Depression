I get embarrassed when I tell my shoe size and height.
I mean it’s the truth. I hate being asked how tall I am and what my shoe size them people get shocked on how big I am. One time I had my family over and one of my aunts friends was looking at my new shoes and was shocked at my shoe size. She said out loud, (my name) YOU WEAR A SIZE 14?! You wear a size 14 wide in women’s?! (My name) YOU HAVE BIG FEET!!” With a shocked and nasty look. Everyone just looked at me. I was embarrassed. My male cousins said,  “14?! Damn that’s HUGE! Especially for a woman! I’m a guy and I only wear a size 11 and I’m a guy! Quite frankly, that’s embarrassing, but she’s a tall, big girl what did you expect?
The girl’s friend said, “Damn girl! How do you even find shoes?! That is HUMONGOUS. No offense. I have tiny feet. At least we can find shoes. 
My aunt was just looking at and didn’t say anything. She gave me that “Well it’s true” look. 
The girl said, “(My name) not a lot of women have that shoe size, plus you’re tall so it’s perfectly proportional for your size. I wear a size 8-9 and I’m 5’3 and people thought it was big for my size.”
None of my family said anything to her shouting how big my feet are.
That’s why when someone asked about my shoe size, I don’t wanna say but them one of my family just shouts it out and say I always take too long to answer. I am still struggling to accept I will never be a tiny/little woman. I’m 6ft and large framed. My late dad always reminded me that there’s NOTHING little about me and he doesn’t sugarcoat it.
