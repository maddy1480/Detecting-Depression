I got mentioned in a Bored Panda article today (from an AskReddit post I did) and got a grand total of: 1 New Subscriber
Kind of disappointing (very disappointing) but I am grateful to the dude who wrote the article, he wrote some nice things about me and linked my channel twice. They built the article off of an AskReddit question I posted (What is the most Ridiculous rule you’ve heard someone have for their family/house/children?). Anyway I guess I got hopes up too much because they have like 160m monthly visits. I’ll keep on truckin’.
