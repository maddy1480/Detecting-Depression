What’s the meaning behind your name?
I had a Uber driver today and he was from Nigeria. He had a really unique name and I always make it a habit to try and pronounce the persons name correctly the first time - I repeat it in my head sometimes. Anyways when I entered the car and said “Hello, ____?” He was silent for a moment and then he said “you know you said my name spot on my man?”

He then asked me how to pronounce my name and what it means. My name is Harrattan and it roughly translates to jewel of God or devotee of God depending on how you interpret it. 

What does your name translate to? You don’t have to say what your name is if you want to remain anonymous.
