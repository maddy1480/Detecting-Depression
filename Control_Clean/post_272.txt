Just a full moon feelings
Oh yes! My woter just broke. I'm having a child that I wanted so much. He was perfect... Touching him, holding him and the smell of him... I instantly fell in love.

They told me there were some complications at the birth, his brain didn't have enough oxigen, but I thought it woud develop or compansate at one point.
He wasn't developed as others, but for me, he was still perfect.

Months, years have passed and he wasn't able to speak or walk.

I was pregnant again. I had a girl. Lovely, gentle little creature I could also give all my love to.
After five years, she asked me: Could you give me a sibling I could talk too?

I felt blame, I felt, at the first time of my life, that I could not help the first child as long as I was hoping. I can just love him unconditionally, as I did. 
But yes, I had another child. 

Fear of me gone and him staying by himself was so overwhelming, I felt I had no choice. 
There's nothing more precious than children and the love for them. 

My oldest is now 20. We still all live together. 
The other two are a team, the oldest one is just here for love. 

I admit, sometimes I'm so tired, sometimes it bothers me why I'm living such a life, but when I sit with him and silently look into his eyes, I know exactly why he's here, here but not here. For Love. With such a purity, warmth, inocenence, and still with the beauty of that baby that I first held in my arms.
