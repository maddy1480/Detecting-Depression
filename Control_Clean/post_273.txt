Would it be impractical to buy a flip phone in today’s world?
I’m 22F and social media is taking over my mental health. Just having an account in general isn’t bad (especially since it’s a good way of keeping in touch with family and friends) but having 24/7 access to it in my pocket wherever I go has made me obsessed with it and feel like a zombie that’s always looking at my screen. My first instinct whenever I’m bored is to pull up tik tok or Instagram or Twitter or Snapchat, any of those. It’s like my fingers have a mind of their own and do it without my brain processing it. Same thing with mobile games and other apps, I feel like I’m just always on my phone. 

I’ve been kicking around the idea of paying this phone off and then switching mainly over to a flip phone that will allow me to call and text and that’s it. I know I can just delete the apps and try to have self control, but part of me wants to quit cold turkey and change my lifestyle. I feel like my attention span has plummeted and I’m losing productivity due to always wanting to be on my phone. But is it practical in todays society? For example for multiple job interviews they texted me a link to a website rather than emailing it, so I don’t know how that would be accomplished on a phone that’s not a smart phone with easy-to-navigate internet browser (I know some flip phones have internet on it, but still). Also with some restaurants making you scan a QR code to access their menu, and then traveling is so much easier with a mobile passport.

Anyways, I just wanted some opinions on this and rather or not I’m being realistic about this.
