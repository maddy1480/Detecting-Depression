I’ve made really good friends
I’m going to be starting the next stage of my life soon and I was worried about making friends. Not so long after, I got added to a group chat where I met all of these wonderful people. We talk every day now. There’s new conversations happening at any time and we’re al different individuals that connect very well. I’ve never met people who I’ve genuinely got along with very well. They’re appreciative, communicative, and lots of other qualities I want in a friendship. I just wanted to express how excited I am to discover the potential of our relationships and how it will improve me as a person. If for some reason we don’t stay together, I strongly believe they will have a positive effect on my life nonetheless.
