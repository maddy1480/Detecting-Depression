Advice on how to respond to a stupid complaint?
I sold an old tablet on ebay "For Parts - Won't boot." The  buyer just sent a message complaining that and I quote: "It does not charge, you stated it didnt boot up,,that's different,,not happy" 

How do I explain that it's impossible for me to tell if a device charges when it won't boot? 

I mean, what was he expecting?
