Could the job market gotten more difficult in the past year?
I graduated in 2021 with a computer science degree and although my GPA was scraping 2.6, I had school projects, side projects, unrelated work, and time in comp.sci. research to put onto my resume. I got several interviews coming in one after another almost immediately after graduation, averaging about 1 every week, until I finally landed my first job within 7 months of searching. (Note: My projects weren't mind blowing enough to make up for my shit GPA. I'm very average.)

My sister, on the other hand, graduated a year after me with the same degree and a 3.8 GPA. She has school projects and obviously the grades to prove her understanding. She's a hard worker and very capable,. I seriously thought she'd land a job faster than me, but she hasn't had a single call back since she started to apply last December.

Has the job market gotten this bad in the last year? I know many of the bigger companies aren't hiring, but 0 call backs for 3 months?
