I’ve given up on the www. Texting has dug me within a swirly digital WiFi lookin mud lake.. Might as well go get a shack or van out in the woods and start a silent retreat. Is talking to your
self accepted in the average silent retreat boundaries??

Bunging to my nxt q. Back in the day the definition of talking to yourself was vocally verbalizing with no one else around ,  the definition of talking to yourself may be different these days!?🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️different nowadays, ;;when one that is talking to his/her self is also in earshot of an active mics earshot vicinity. I believe that this is NOT talking to oneself.
