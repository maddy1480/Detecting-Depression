Anyone have any tips for motion sickness?
I got a new job which requires a commute by bus. I’d like to use my mornings for reading, but I get really easily motion sick if I try to read while on the bus. Normally I’ll use Dramamine for long car/plane rides, but I don’t think it would be healthy to take every day lol. 

Anyone have any non-medication tips so I can read on my commute? :)
