My little brother is graduating today and I’m jealous
like the tittle says my little brother is graduating today. He deserves every single praise and expensive gift he’s gotten. He’s genuinely a great kid and even though I’m older I look up to him. But I hate to say this out loud I can’t help but feel sad and a bit jealous because when I graduated a few years ago I bought my own flowers and begged my mom to stop by the store so I could buy a cake after the ceremony. My parents got him a snazzy outfit and I had to borrow a dress from a friend.
