She went in for a hug.
I [M22] became friends with a girl [F22] about a year ago when we had several classes together. We’d often study together and over time we both opened up about our personal lives which led to us becoming friends. One day, she told me about how a few years ago before she transferred to our university she dealt with a classmate who stalked her both in-person and online. She told me that because of this she developed trust issues with men and avoided any physical touch with them beyond a fist bump or handshake. However, she had grown to trust me and, along with her gay friend, I was the only other guy who she’d give a fistbump to when we’d say goodbye. A few days ago, me, her, and one of her girl friends spent the day at the aquarium and went to eat dinner after. At the end of the day when we were going to get into our cars and drive home I put my hand out for a fistbump, but she did something that took me by surprise: she hugged me. 

I know it was just a simple friendly hug, but for her to signify that she trusts me that much, and for me to know that this girl trusts me enough for her to break her physical barrier considering how emotionally closed-off she is with other guys, it felt amazing. We’ve both made it indirectly clear that neither of us are looking for relationships, and I’ve never gotten any flirty vibes from her in the past, so I don’t think there was anything beyond friendly affection with that hug but still, it felt great. It feels so nice to be trusted. 

TLDR: A friend who has trust issues with guys and never shows them physical affection gave me (a dude) a hug.
