Chores are actually relaxing
I don't know when it happened but sometime this year I stopped looking at chores as something boring and annoying I have to do every once in awhile. Now I actually look forward to do them because I realized it's a time I can use to relax. I can just pop in some headphones and listen to music or a podcast and just let my hands do their thing. Anyone else agree?
