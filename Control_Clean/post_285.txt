Had a consultation with a  today!
I’ve had experience with a  before, about 2 years back..except I didn’t know that there was a difference. It may not be the case for everyone, but it seemed like my  didn’t give a single shit LMAO. Is that just how they are? “Sorrows..sorrows, prayers..now here’s some meds.” It was terrible! Even just *one week* on the meds, I knew it wasn’t a good fit for me. Not to mention just how invalidating it felt overall. It took me until today to actually get motivation back to continue to seek help. 

Anyway, hoping all goes well with my insurance because I really like the . She was already so validating and we haven’t even gotten into the deep shit lmao. I struggle with (or as she said mentioned it today, am *paralyzed*) by my anxiety so it feels really fucking good to feel like you’ve found something that just might finally work.
