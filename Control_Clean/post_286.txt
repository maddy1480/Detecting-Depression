I'm waiting to get stitches for the first time in my life. Keep me company?
I cut my hand on my bathtub and I'm waiting to get stitches. As per Canadian usual, the wait lasts forever. Keep me company? 

I like reading, mostly sci fi and fantasy. I am almost always listening to music. Stardew valley is my favorite video game. I like to garden. I work as a pastry chef. Talk to me about anything!
