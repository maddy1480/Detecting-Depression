Have you ever read a review of a book that left you wondering if you even read the same book as that person?
Seems to happen to me with some frequency,  have you experienced this? 

Recently looked through an archived thread on Killing Commendatore. Several comments were saying they wished the book spent any time discussing the main characters boredom and loneliness and I just... what? That's the entire point. If the book didn't discuss that it would've been like 15 pages.
