I have a 72-year-old classmate.
I am amazed by this grandpa who goes to college to fulfill his dreams. I talked to him about why he enrolled in college at his age. He said that he never went to college and he had to work to support his family. His children made it possible and supported his college journey. 


It is never too late for us to fulfill our dreams. Thank you, Grandpa, for the motivation.

PS. He looks cute in his uniform tho. ðŸ˜ƒ
