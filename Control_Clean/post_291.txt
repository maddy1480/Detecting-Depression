had a genuine conversation with a potential scammer
should i be worried? they opened with the usual, “oh no, i must have been given the wrong number!” and i decided to fuck with them a little and engage them in a full-on, rambling convo where i just asked them personal questions and talked way too much about my own opinions. i was bored, idk. 

weird thing is, they responded (seemingly) honestly and it was a pretty interesting convo. i even gave them a song recommendation (“Sunday” by The Cranberries if anyone’s interested) and they said they would listen to it. 

at the end, they gave me their personal phone number on Whatsapp (which i will NOT be texting). still, though i’m honestly looking forward to texting them tomorrow. 

all i gave them about me was my gender and the country i live in. no name or age or specific state or anything like that, and i don’t plan on giving that info out anytime soon. 

is this a scammer? they just seem like a harmless stranger. should i block them? will i get doxxed or something if i continue engaging them? 

i just wanna see where this goes for the fun of it, but i also don’t wanna be an idiot.
