Any recommendations on Youtube Channels?
Any recommendations on Youtube Channels? I donot want anything that is too formal like VOX, VICE, things about science or news and so on. I used to watch plenty of them. I also don't want something that is too clickbait or too loud. I like one good looking person or two talk, in a chill, down to earth way. I was watching Dr Mike chat with Dr Hope's sick note.  It was quite enjoyable, chill, lighthearted, and fun. And I discovered Dr hope, I love his channel, Wondering if there are more similar channels, not necessarily about medical. any topic works
