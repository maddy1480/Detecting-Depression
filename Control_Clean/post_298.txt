How could Lakers lost by 0-4???
I'm reading some sport news and was shocked by Lakers.I'm not quite an NBA fan but I do watch some games and compilations. I ain't a basketball nerd but Lakers has LBJ, AD and such, and Nuggets, on the other hand, I can only recall one star, Jokic. And, Lakers even beat GSW not so long ago.
