I made a costly mistake and can't forgive myself
Yesterday I damaged a motherboard while doing some maintenance and didn't even immediately notice it. I'm not at all new to this kind of things and I never, ever, had any issue because I'm always extra careful, knowing how frail hardware can be.

Now I have to buy a replacement for 200 bucks and I'm devastated for throwing that kind of money out of the window, plus I feel like an idiot and I've completely lost my confidence. I never thought something like this would happen to me. I know mistakes can happen but I really can't make my peace with this.
