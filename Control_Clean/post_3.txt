Today the build of a hospital i designed started!
Hello everybody,

I don't really have someone to share this with, but today they start building the hospital i have been designing and drawing over the last 6 months! This is one of the first projects of which i did like 85% of all the work myself instead of dividing parts between other architects.

I'm really excited as this will be one of the bigger hospitals in the Netherlands :D

It will be 4 stories high, have a radiology part and will be available to help people with cancer etc, located pretty centered in the Netherlands so that's great!

Tell me what you think!

Edit 1: For those asking, im 25 years old :)

Edit 2: I get alot of pm's asking how i got into this work:

Yes i am very young, i actually got into this work because of a medical condition i have, low latent inhibition, but with my iq it’s a good thing. Basically my brain can process more stimuli making me think/see what things are made up of for instance. In the serie prison break, Michael Scofield has the same thing, in the serie they make it as if we see every bolt lmao but that’s not true.

They found this out about me at a young age, so i was kind of pushed into technical stuff, as it calms me and i enjoy it!
