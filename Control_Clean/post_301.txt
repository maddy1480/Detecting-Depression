my birthday
yesterday was my birthday, I’m 19 now. I don’t really know how I feel. Only few people remembered about me. Mostly I feel very lonely and kinda sad. There was my dad to cheer me up, but it just felt out  of place. I really wished my life was different, and I didn’t had to feel this bad and want to disappear on my own birthday.
