Starting a digital store
It’s nerve wracking to put yourself out there, but here I am! My plan is to go live on Saturday. I’m expecting to have 5 pieces ready by then. I still have to make product photos, but the copy is done and the product is done for 3/5. I still want input from my bf on final touches. 

I’ve poured a lot of heart into making these products, so I hope the public likes it.
