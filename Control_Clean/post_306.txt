I'm struggling to achieve my dream of financial freedom
I'm in my 20s, and currently working with very less compensation. I am very skilled and is able to do a lot of things excellently (especially on certain niches). I know that the best option is to transfer jobs and look for something that pays me handsomely, but the problem is that this job is out of a 'personal calling', I love serving people, helping them, being in nonprofits. 

But I just have huge dreams and aspirations in life. I want to travel to Asia, Europe, give a good marriage to my wife and my future family. 

Ive tried forex trading, I'm really good at demo, I've been studying it for more than 4 years. But for some reason I'm failing during the real trading. I've been down around $200-300 all my life. It may not be a lot, but I am compensated less, so it's a lot for me. 

I am so confused.
