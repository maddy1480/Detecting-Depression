Is it weird that I wear my rings like that?
I wear three rings on my left ring finger. The first ring is my husband's wedding ring. He doesn't wear his and gave me permission to wear his ring. The second one is my engagement ring. The third one is my own wedding ring. Both my husband's and my wedding ring are thick, and my engagement ring is medium length with a diamond on top. They all have the same finger size and fit nearly well (because my fingers are thicker than I thought).

The reason why I am asking this is because it may make me look like a widow. So do you think it is weird that I wear my rings like that?
