Someone said they were proud of me :')
I'm a senior music major in college. I had a rehearsal with a pianist today who I've only performed with a handful of times in the past 4 years.

She was really impressed with my playing and she said "I remember you from when you were a freshman, I knew you were going to be this good back then."

Left the practice room and started to tear up. It feels good to hear that from people you look up to.
