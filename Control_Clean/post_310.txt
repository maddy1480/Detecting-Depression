In a weird place. It is weird, right?
I had just been dating someone for a little over a month who dumped me today. I'm not super upset. I feel like I should be.

 I was on tinder and looking for something casual and short term. I have some shit I have to focus on, but I wouldn't mind casual company in my spare time.  I'm pretty damaged from a previous relationship and I dont need to bring that into a serious relationship. Plus, I'm gutting and renovating my home while working full time. I have shit I need to get done.  He was aware of all of that and he pursued me hard. 

I eventually agreed to exclusivity and now all of a sudden it's a concern I have so much I have to do and he doesn't see us working out. 

A part of me is a little sad. A small part relieved. But otherwise, nothing. 

Is that weird?
