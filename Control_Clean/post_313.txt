I had the most amazing birthday today
I turned 21 today, and I really had the best time today.

I had nothing special planned for today (holding a big party at a local bar this Friday) but I felt so incredibly loved and appreciated today.

Iâ€™ve been having a hard time lately, and reading all the messages, listening to the voice messages and receiving all those phonecalls really made me feel grateful to be alive.

And to top it all off, my best friend surprised me by swinging by my apartment with dinner, cake and a bottle of champagne.

I honestly cannot stop smiling.
