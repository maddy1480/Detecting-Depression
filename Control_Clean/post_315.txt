What are some books/movies/people etc who inspire or motivate you?
Been feeling kind of stagnant and cynical lately and I want to recapture the feelings of optimism and excitement about life that I used to have when I was younger. Read any good self-help books lately? Are there any tv shows, songs/musicians, movies, or documentaries that help you see the world in a different way? Are there any particular people who inspire you? I want to hear all about it!
