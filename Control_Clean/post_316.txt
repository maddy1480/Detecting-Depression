What’s the best dish you’ve ever cooked/baked?
I recently made one of the best burgers I’ve ever had with Kobe beef, smoked gouda, butter lettuce, caramelized onions, a home made bun baked by my SO, artisan pickle chips, and a rich burger sauce. It was amazing, and I realized if we’d home made some fries it could’ve been one of the best plates I’ve ever created. What’s your all-time best food creation?
