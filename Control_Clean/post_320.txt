Embarrassing story that just happened to me
I spent the night at my partner's and they left for work, and I was inspired so I drew something pretty weird, NSFW and weird. And as I prepared myself to leave I took the page and just... Forgot it!

And I was already out when I remembered, and I JUST.COULDN'T.LEAVE.IT.THERE.

First because is not yet finished, and second because is not meant for my partner to see just like that, it needs some mental preparation, so I absolutely had to go back for it.

I had to message my partner to ask if any of their roomies was up so they could open the door for me, and fortunately one was. And they were so kind to help me, omg I was almost crying (laughing), I apologized a lot and went for the drawing and left.

I cannot believe this happened, I didn't say what was that I forgot tho...

Has anything embarrassing happened to you recently?

Was it really embarrassing with other people, or was it just embarrassing for you? In my case it was just embarrassing for me but it would've been embarrassing with others if I had forgotten completely and my partner came home to it lol.
