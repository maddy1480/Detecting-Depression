What is a show/movie/documentary that you've watched and would recommend?
I have had a lot of free time recently and I thought I'd ask here to see if anyone had anything good they've watched recently and would recommend! I'll watch just about anything with a good story or idea behind it so it doesn't matter and I have access to most streaming services so recommend away with whatever interesting and entertaining things you've watched!
