I want to make the perfect sausage biscuit.
So here lately, I've been preparing sausage biscuits for breakfast before work. Unfortunately, and quite frankly, they suck. Mostly the sausage part. They're far too greasy and taste nothing like what I'd get from a takeout restaurant, Tennessee pride brand, or even a circle K grab & go. 

Let's brainstorm some products I could check out, or techniques I could use!
