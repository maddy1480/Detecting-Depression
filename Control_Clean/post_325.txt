I did it!
I've been working for years on writing a book of short stories. I worked on it a lot in college, then mental health things took over and I stopped writing at all for a while. But, I finally finished editing everything and it's been sent off to the people who volunteered to be beta readers! I know I still have a long way to go before I can (maybe, hopefully) see my book on the shelves at Barnes and Noble someday, but I'm one step closer!!
