I love my friends :)
I'm single like a pringle and in love with a man completely out of reach which can get preeeetty lonely. But whenever I'm with my friends I feel great! A little less alone. Sometimes I wanna tell them outright how much I love them and care for them but my internal cheesiness police stops me from doing so (except in like one occasion I remember where I cheesily told them I missed them while eating pasta). Oh well. I love you homies :').

If anyone wanna tell me about how their friends are awesome I'm all ears~
