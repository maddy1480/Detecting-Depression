Telling adoptive family that I found my Bio family
Adopted at 6 months from a catholic social home in suburban Buffalo into a large, loving, caring family. My adoptive parents adopted two more children and I became one of 56 grandchildren spread out amongst 9 families that were close enough to socialize nearly every weekend.

My own children ask, "How many weddings have you been to Dad, 50 plus" I would say, and more first communions to.

60 plus years since, all but one of my aunts and uncles have passes as have 15 or so cousins, sad to say the least. Lots of Irish wakes to add to the event total.

A few years back, just prior to COVID, I took a DNA test and low and behold I discovered another 30 or so first cousins, birth parents who have passed, etc. I have met only half of them, but trying to meet everyone.

&#x200B;

My question is how to or should I tell my adoptive family? All know I am adopted, none of them ever mentioned it, I was simply accepted as one of them and, and yes I am the luckiest person in the whole world.

I feel I should simply tell them, but not sure of reactions, any thoughts?

Thanks
