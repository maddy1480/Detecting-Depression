I did a thing....
I just submitted an application for a new job.  Been with my current office for close to 10 yrs and love what I do. But last month I had an apt somewhere and they were looking for an office manager, which I currently am.  I went online and perused thru the job description and talked it over with my family.  Decided if the position was still open when I went for my follow-up, I'd put in an app. Well, it's still open so today I did it. I submitted the application with my resume. Now it's a waiting game. While the waiting gives me a form of anxiety, the worst they can do it tell me 'not interested'.  Either way, I'll be ok.
