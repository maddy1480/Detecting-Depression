Anyone else have, what I like to call, my spaghetti stomach?
I can eat LOADS of spaghetti when I can barely eat  a whole lot of anything else. 

I call it my spaghetti stomach. 

My friend had the same thing for Crab Rangoon.

What is YOUR "spaghetti stomach?" (The food you can't inexplicably eat a lot and never get full from)

ETA: I just wanted to say thank you for all the interaction with this post! I love reading what you all enjoy eating! And it seems like pasta, sushi, and tacos are three of the most common second stomachs here!
