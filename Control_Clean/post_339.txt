There is something about the way people carry themselves
That says so much about who they are.  Body language, facial expressions, posture, etc are all things that I notice, maybe Iâ€™m weird lol, and read into about people.  Sometimes I may read too much into it but more often than not you can learn so much about someone just by watching them.  Thoughts?
