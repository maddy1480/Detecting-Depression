Is it wrong to have fun and go out with friends without telling parents
I am 22 F from India, my parents are too strict. They are so overprotective, they want to know everything, like where i am how i am doing. I should be at home after office. I am currently working in different city but my parents wants to be at my flat after office. And i like going out with my friends. And all my friends are male. But they are very good people. But my parents think going out with boys is bad.

And i go out with them, have fun, watch movies, drinks. And i am hiding these things from my parents at home. So am i doing right or wrong. I want to enjoy my life. I spent my college life at home because of covid. And as my parents are so controlling and overprotetive i wasn't able to enjoy and have fun in my teens or in college. They also doesn't give me permission to go even with my female friends. So please help me
