I am awful at flirting and giving signs to men
probably not the right place for this but if I like you I will make stupid jokes around you and we will probably end up having a million inside jokes. You'll never know I like you because I won't tell you. I have a theory that my close guy friend likes me and he's very flirty touchy. Whenever we're together after a few drinks he will grab me by the waist when we're walking down the street after happy hour with other friends. I feel comfortable around him. I think we just trust each other.
