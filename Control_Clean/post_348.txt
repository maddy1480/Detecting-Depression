Texting... kinda sucks
It's just never right, the tone always sounds wrong, too formal, too casual, too intense, too meek...

It's like that for both texts that I send and receive, I feel like most people (including me) just don't come through well in text.

I could be texting one of my best friends, freaking love the dude IRL, but then while texting it just feels very off and sometimes stuff they write just feels so out of character (tho that could probably be tied to tone not coming through)

Interested to hear y'alls thoughts, have you figured out how to do texting right? I've been going the voice messages route, but it seems a lot of people don't really like doing that.
