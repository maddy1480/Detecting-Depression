I am an overthinker, correct me if I am wrong
I'm a master's student who is currently struggling to make ends meet. I told my parents that I can handle this on my own no matter what, and I want to be independent, so I am too proud to approach them for financial assistance. PS: Because I only have two months left on my student visa and I don't speak German very well, I've decided to work odd jobs. I've just started working as a kitchen assistant in a hotel in Germany. 

I need some guidance on whether or not I should resign. 

I have a lot of plates to clean and a kitchen to manage. Although I used to feel that this task was beneath me, here I am.

I was embarrassed beyond belief when the owner became unhappy with me today for not being able to clean 20 utensils quickly enough. He claimed that I lacked brains and that I also spilled some tomatoes unintentionally out of anxiety. Is this kind of reprimand normal? Should I just give up now? I sobbed the entire way home, but just before he left, he murmured, "Good job," and handed me some bread and cheese. Did he regard me as beneath him or a helpless Indian girl? Am I thinking too much? Should I give up right away?community suggests something.
