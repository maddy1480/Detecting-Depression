It was funny in my head.
I’m having breakfast at a cafe trying to wake up and this sheepish old lady just asks me if I have the time and mind you, I am really out of it, so I just say the first thing that comes to mind and it went something like “I try, but it just seeps through my fingers like sand like some constant reminder of our mortality.”
