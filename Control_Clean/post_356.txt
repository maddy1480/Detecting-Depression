I'm getting a puppy today, what should I name him?
He's a corgi/jack russell mix, about 12 weeks old. I haven't had a dog in years because I had my last dog from age 9 to 25 so I was devastated when she passed away. Something clicked the other day though and I'm ready to give love to a dog again. I'm having a hard time deciding between a funny name like a food or a TV character, or a regular-schmegular human name like Dave or Randall or something. I could use some suggestions, if you're not busy.
