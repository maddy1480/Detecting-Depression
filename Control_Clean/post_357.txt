Shall I move in back to my father's place?
hey, me (m,26) have been living separately and independantly from my parants since i was 22. working differnt low-paying jobs, i havent achieved anything in my life and honestly dont have much clue. I write in  my free time but not even sure if my writing is that good. my father is 50 now, living alone. Shall i keep trying to find myself and my meaning in life or shall i rather kinda give up and move back to my dad and help him with his business ?

Im just asking for advice, cause i feel a bit lost and stuck.
