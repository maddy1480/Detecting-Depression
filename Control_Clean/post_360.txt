Which tv show or tv shows were you addicted to until you lost interest in it?
Mine was the Supernatural 

it was good until season 3, after season 5 was when I dropped it like a hot potato.

the first 3 episodes of season 6 was mediocre 

way worse then the last 8 episodes of season 5

I wonder if it is still going on though ..
