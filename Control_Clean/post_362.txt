I feel anxious thinking about leaving the house, but actually leaving is nice
I have such a hard time leaving the house, the thought of it makes me feel so sick and anxious, but actually going outside and being on the bus it feels much better when you go outside. I have to keep reminding myself it is worth it to go outside.
