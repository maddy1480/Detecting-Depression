What made you happy today? :)
For example, even though I was in a pretty bad mood today, I received a text from a person which means a lot to me, which isn’t much but still a reason to say that this day wasn’t as bad as I thought! 


Sometimes it doesn't need something big or special too make someone's day a little better. If so, what was it for you? Or what could be something you’re looking forward to?
