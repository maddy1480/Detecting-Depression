Cleaning can be satisfying?
So, I have this habit of just leaving my clothes on the sofa and not putting them away in the drawers and sometimes it accumulates and gets messy (rest of the room is neat and tidy lol). I was sorting the clothes out and the next minute I was basically aggressively cleaning my room and washroom. Worth it. Anyone else just randomly start cleaning shit?
