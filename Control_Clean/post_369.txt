22 M still in search of the evasive chat and possible long term friendship!
Good morning/ evening/ afternoon to all my fellow redditors! I am a 22 y/o man from the central US still searching for someone who can hold a conversation! I’m not too picky about who I talk to, as long as you can hold a conversation and reply at least somewhat regularly!

About me: I am about 5’10” tall, I have blue eyes and light brown hair, a brown and red mixed beard. I was an avid sneaker collector, and am now trying to start again. I watch tv and movies from time to time. I enjoy eating and cooking and trying new foods and recipes. I play video games with my friends when we’re both magically free from the tight jaws of work lol. Other than that, there’s not much to me! Just a Midwestern blue collar fella :)

If any of this interested you, please feel free to DM or chat at me! Have a good day everyone :)
