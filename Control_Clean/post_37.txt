I love making ppl cry
Have you ever made someone laugh so hard they shed a tear? Itâ€™s the best feeling ever. I genuinely enjoy making ppl laugh til they cry, or laugh so hard their stomach starts hurting. It brings me so much joy to see someone cracking my up at something silly I said. Especially if they have one of those wheezy laughs ðŸ¤£
