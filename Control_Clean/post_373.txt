what i’ve decided to do with raising my kids with phones based on my childhood
hi guys, this sub may not be for this, and if it is not, please let me know and i will delete it.

I’m nowhere near the point of my life where i should be thinking about raising my own child, I am only 15, but I have been thinking for a while about how much of an influence i would want the internet and technology to have on my children, i may sound like an asshole for this, but i really do not want my children to have phones or ipads at all, but i have come to terms on a few things and decided it would be ok as long as i follow these things

i will let my kids have phones, but will not include them on a mobile plan until they hit middle school.

banned apps: apps i do not want my children on at all.

TikTok: i’m not a TikTok hater, I love TikTok myself, but young children become SO addicted to it SUPER fast, I just do not want my kids having that kind of an addiction that early in life. My sister is a victim of TikTok addiction, she watches it full blast with no regards of others, we have to yell her name to get her out of her trance, and when she had friends over, none of them talked, they all blasted TikTok full blast the entire time.

Snapchat: My kids can have Snap whenever they get into middle school, when most of their peers have it and they know internet safety like who to talk to, I just put this in this section because I don’t want them having it at an Elementary age.

Reddit: Honestly, anyone under the age of 13 would embarrass themselves coming to Reddit, most 13 year olds do embarrass themselves. and it is too easy to find terrible stuff too fast. gore, shitkinks, etc. Reddit is debatable whenever they get in to high school.

Any apps that grant unlimited access to the internet: I want to be able to control what my children see, like obviously I wouldn’t want them trying to do an illegal download of one of the apps i just mentioned and get a virus.

Apps that I am still thinking about: I don’t want to necessarily ban these apps, but I do not want them having the full capabilities of everything on the app.

YouTube: I was raised by YouTube so this may be biased, but I don’t want my kids to have a YouTube account until they figure out how to make one by themselves, because by the time they are able to do so, I would trust that they would be too mature to end up on r/youngpeopleyoutube I also do not want them on YouTube shorts because that’s basically lower quality TikTok

FaceBook: I want my kids to stay informed, and I feel that FaceBook is one of the safest social media, also their interpretation of TikTok is 10 minute long videos where they keep leading you on about popping a balloon, so I would believe that my kids would not rely on it for their heroin shot, the only thing I am worried about is all the extreme political propaganda that they would see.

am i thinking too harshly? what should I add to the list? really the only thing I am solid about is NO TikTok and the deal with the make your own youtube account.
