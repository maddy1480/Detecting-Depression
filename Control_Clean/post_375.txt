Excess of watching movies and tv shows?
So I'm kind of worried in the capacity that i really watch alot of movies and tv shows. 
I really enjoy them but i do watch alot of them and i was thinking is it harmful as to watching too much? 
Do we get further away from the reality of life? Does it have an adverse effect? 
I know this might be a stupid question but i just wanted to see if anyone else felt like that....
