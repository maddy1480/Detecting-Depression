Be nice to people and appreciate the ones that are nice to you!
I know you've probably heard this so many times, but a small act of kindness just genuinely being nice towards someone especially strangers, receiving kindness and a bit of love in this world, it's like finding a diamond in a pile of manure. The people who know the value of kindness will cherish you and carry it with them for the rest of their lives.
