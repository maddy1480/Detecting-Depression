It's scary how 5 years just flew past
20 back in 2018, 25 now. Holy shit, time really flies. In another 5 years I will be 30, that's kinda ...shocking to think of and it's giving me existential dread. I still feel like I'm stuck in my late teenage years and I don't feel like I'm ready to reach my late 20s to early 30s at all. Anyone feels the same way?
