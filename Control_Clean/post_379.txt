I signed up for an Intro Salsa/Bachata class.
I’ve never learned to dance before, but I’ve always wanted to try. I’m *really* excited but also *really* terrified as well. I’m honestly surprised that I was able to convince myself to do this; I consider myself a risk adverse person most of the time. Is there something that you’ve always wanted to do, but haven’t had the courage to do so until recently?
