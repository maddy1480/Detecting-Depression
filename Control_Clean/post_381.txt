It finally happened. I deliberately clicked on an ad
Just a minute ago, I saw an ad here on reddit for a local farm having a donut weekend soon. Never heard of this before but i like nontraditional donut flavors (ntm places around here do stuff like apple cider donuts in fall), so i clicked. I read the entire page, and I'm genuinely thinking of attending it!

So after processing that, it occurred to me that this was a unique interaction. I had the intended feedback loop of "oh interesting, lemme find out more! Oh ok i will partake!" and we all know what internet ads are like. Even if its an otherwise relevant item for you, its always intrusive and just pisses you off. But yet, here I am. Maybe ad technology has advanced enough to do what id set out to do instead of, ya know, just annoy us lol

Anyone else ever done this?
