I am trying to grow some flowers in my apt complex, and landscaping went around them.
We moved into a new development in January and it had no grass, so I decided to plant a few bulbs in March. I’ve had a few bad months and the flowers I’ve grown on my back patio have been a nice way for me to water and take care of something. I knew they probably would be cut down with the landscaping and they just cut around them and it’s making me so happy. Hopefully we’ll have some roses and gladiolus soon!
