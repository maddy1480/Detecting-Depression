I stopped drinking and it didn’t change much.
Just to preface, I’ve never had a problem with alcohol. 

Nothing major. But I stopped drinking this year. I’m always hearing people say they’re doing so much better since stopping. I’m a little underwhelmed with the results lol. Im generally healthy, seem to eat way healthier than most, workout regularly, lots of water, etc. 

Im not upset or anything, but I guess I expected to notice some kind of life change. I suppose I’m probably saving some money but it can’t amount to more than $20 a month. 

Anyone else had a similar feeling when they started a healthy hobby or stopped a bad one? Maybe I expected too much.
