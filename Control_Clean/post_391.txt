So, I’m about halfway through “Soft & Quiet” on Netflix and, uhhh…..
this definitely wasn’t in the realm of anything I expected. And I’m not normally one to say this, but a content warning maybe could have been helpful beforehand? 

I’m not sure if I will or should continue watching. I’m sure most viewers feel uncomfortable, but it’s also triggering some memories I have growing up in the rural Midwest with a target on my back.

I’m usually not too affected by media, but I guess I’m wondering what people’s thoughts are about this film.  And if the ending happens to be good/sophisticated/thought-provoking enough to make all this discomfort… worth it to continue watching?
