I stumbled across the place of my earliest memories while doing Doordash
I'm still blown away by this. I deliver for DoorDash as my main source of income because it's the only job that I can find that pays well and I can do on my own time, plus I enjoy driving. My goal is to earn $100 every day that I go out and I was taking my very last delivery to hit that goal. It was a double apartment setup, two buildings with a lawn between them. As I was reading the apartment numbers I noticed that the place looked familiar, and then it hit me. This was the place I lived for the first 4 years of my life.

Suddenly my earliest memories started coming back to me. I remembered playing in that alley with a couple of older kids. I remembered sitting on that curb and tossing dirt clods into the street to watch them break and scatter. I remembered sitting on that bench with my mom. It was so strange to be standing now at 30 years old in the place I lived for the first few years of my life. I messaged my mom and she confirmed the address was the same and even told me which apartment was ours. I feel like I want to go back and visit in the daytime, on a warm spring day like I remember from the 90s, but I feel like that would be weird. 

Anyway, thanks for listening. I hope this was as interesting to you as it was to me, but maybe it's just hygapean.
