What kind of laptop bag do you have?
Currently looking for a backpack that’s mainly intended for a MacBook but leaves some space for a water bottle etc. 

I really like those clothy looking square ones that sit high up on your back. I’m pretty tall and athletic/built so I’m not sure how good they’ll look. 

I don’t know the name of those, can anyone share which ones they like along with names?
