My coworker did something unexpectedly sweet :)
Just wanted to share somewhere because I thought it was so kind. I mentioned to one of my coworkers that the chocolate chip poptarts were my favorite (they’re amazing if you toast them and have them with a glass of milk), and that they had been discontinued for years and just came back. 
After hearing that, my coworker has brought a pack of chocolate chip poptarts to share with me every night we work together. 
We haven’t previously hung out outside of work, so I just thought it was really sweet of them to do so. :) It made me feel like love is in the poptarts!!! 
Same with another coworker who remembered the Greek salad is my favorite food - when the local Mediterranean place messed up her order and offered to throw something in to make up for it, she asked them to include a Greek salad and brought it to me at work. Love is also in the salad!!
I’m so lucky to have amazing coworkers and friends. This is the first time in my life I’ve felt so cared for. ❤️❤️
Please share similar experiences if you have them! It’s so heartwarming and I feel like we all need reminders that the little things matter.
