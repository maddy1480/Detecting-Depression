So the weirdest thing happened right
I was talking to my sister this morning over Snapchat and through my phone camera there was a jar. A glass jar. I know what I saw. With a lid and detailed glass and everything.

I donâ€™t have any jars in my bedroom. Then when I closed and re opened the app it was gone. I honestly cannot explain this. My only idea is a trick of the light but to see a jar is just so specific?? Was it a ghost of a jar? ðŸ˜‚ Idfk man.
