I wish I could figure out a way to explain to my neighbor that he’s making my life miserable but he could easily fix it
The neighbor in the condo across the hall is weird and exits then re-enters his unit several hundred times a day, often within a minute of the last time he exited and then re-entered. Every time he does this he closes his door with a “thud thud” as it catches on the door jam. This causes my little birds to fly over there and scream at the top of their lungs. Every single time. It takes me hours sometimes to calm them down again after these weird door opening and closing sessions. 

I don’t want to start forcing my birds into their cages all day. Plus they can hear it in their cages as it reverberates throughout. 

I wish I could figure out a way to let him know that it’s fine if he wants to exit and enter his place hundreds of times a day. That’s his prerogative. But it would be great if he could just maybe close the door gingerly. But I don’t feel like it’s my place to tell him how to close his door. In the meantime I’m looking at ways to sound abate. So far the info I’ve gotten isn’t great. Apparently impact noises are the hardest to stop from entering through walls and doors (and ceilings.)

He has thud-thudded his door several times as I wrote this.
