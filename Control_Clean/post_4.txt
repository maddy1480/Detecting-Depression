I give my plants characters and now my husbands likes them too.
My husband never liked the idea of plants in the house but I bought them anyway. I started to refer to them as persons. For example we have a bananatree that is called Andy because of the Andy Warhol banana sticker on the pot (something he did btw!) and we have a plant that is close to our music boxes that is called Robert Plant (singer of Led Zeppelin). Couple days ago I caught him talking to them in a fun way while giving them water and clean the dust of their leaves. I love my husband♥️
