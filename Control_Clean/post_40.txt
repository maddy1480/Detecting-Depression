I was just glancing at this airline meal menu. One of the choices includes cricket powder. I don't think I've ever seen that before. Is that something you might try or is it a turn off?

The Pasta Pescatore includes cricket powder. 

All of the meal choices look pretty good though. I wish US airlines served things like this.
