Who uses a kitchen/dining table and who NEVER DOES?
For those singles out there... I never use the table in my kitchen for eating, and always bring my food to the computer or TV. Anyone else do that? Does anyone actually use their kitchen table anymore? What do *you* do?

I know 'families' of multiple people probably do use a table, but curious if there are families who never do... then where do you eat?
