Advice needed on how to write and draw on a basic white hoodie
I’m planning on making a customised hoodie for my best friend as her birthday gift. I’m planning on writing her favourite lyrics on the back of the hoodie and drawing a doodle she loves, on the front of the hoodie, maybe with ‘(taylor’s version)’ written under it (she’s a massive Taylor Swift fan). I wanted advice on what medium would be good to paint on a white hoodie with, which would stay on the hoodie permanently, and if there are any recommendations about how I could copy the correct font for the ‘(taylor’s version)’ text. Any help would be awesome! I’m thinking of making all of this in black on a white hoodie, and I already have tubes of acrylic colours with me. Would those be fine and stay long enough on the hoodie’s fabric, or would fabric colours be a necessity?

A big thank you to anyone who is able to help!
