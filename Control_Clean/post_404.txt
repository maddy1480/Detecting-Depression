How to make friends?
I’m going to be 23 this year and I’ve only got 2 close friends. One that I grew up with moved across the states a couple of years ago and I don’t see her anymore but we still keep in contact. My other friend I hang out with once in a while but she’s very busy and independent which is amazing for her. But I feel like I could use at least a couple more friends. I feel lonely a lot of the time and I feel like making friends might help because I’d have someone even just to hang out with and talk to. My bf has a lot of commitments and I find myself being alone a lot of the time and I don’t enjoy my own company so I usually hang out with family but there’s nothing like having good friends around you. Any thoughts or ideas on how to make more friends? Out of school and my work is all older people.
