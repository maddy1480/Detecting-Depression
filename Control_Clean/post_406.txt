My husband burst into the room last night to tell me how excited he was about a new discovery. He just discovered Tasmania and Transylvania are real places. What’s your “reverse Santa Clause”?
I was minding my own business, sleeping on the couch, when he bursts in, saying “I had no idea they were real!” This man’s mind was truly blown. These places obviously feature heavily in books and movies, but he always assumed they were fictional. I have no idea why. 

Now I have to know other people’s “reverse Santa Claus” moment in order to make it worth the loss of sleep. What was something or somewhere you thought was made up until you found out it was true? How did you figure it out?
