"Being kind to yourself" has not been effective achieving goals or meeting deadlines
In my experience, being kind to myself has not been effective in helping me achieve goals or meet deadlines. Instead, I have found that I need to rely on two primary emotions: the promise of monetary reward and the fear of humiliation.  
Whenever I try to be kind to myself by taking a day off or giving myself breaks, it doesn't work. My brain tends to repeat excuses of having worked many hours the previous day as a reason to further delay my tasks. This pattern has repeated itself, even when I have important things that need to be finished.  
On a positive note, I have never missed any goals or deadlines because I am motivated by external factors. I use the temptation of financial rewards or the fear of experiencing future humiliation to push myself to complete tasks on time. For example, when it comes to work projects, the possibility of a salary increase or the fear of losing my job motivates me (I wrote another post how money motivates me a lot!). In terms of wanting to lose weight, my motivation comes from not wanting to appear fat rather than focusing on my overall health.

I know this is not good in the long term but nothing else has worked so far - my monkey brain only works for monetary reward or from fear tactic. It does not listen when I am kinder to it, so I have to beat into it.
