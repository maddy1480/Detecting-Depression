How transparent do you like your doctors to be?
I’d love to know your thoughts on this scenario - 

Before starting the procedure, I asked the patient if they would like me to walk them through it, and they agreed. As I performed the procedure, I used the term "mild pain" to describe what they might feel, while assuring them it would be brief.

Later on, the attending physician advised me to use the term "discomfort" instead of "pain" in the future. Their reasoning was that the word "pain" might be too strong and could potentially create unnecessary anxiety or fear in the patient, which I completely understand . 

But the main reason I chose to use "pain" was because the procedure itself was inherently painful, and I wanted to be honest and transparent with the patient. But the attending ’s suggestion got me thinking. 

I'm interested to know your thoughts on this or if you have any experiences or insights to share.
