Anyone had a parent’s voice in their head for a long time that later disappeared?
Sort of a bizarre question but I was curious if anyone else had experienced this. My first relationship when I was about 15, I remember constantly being inundated with my moms voice giving me advice on any little situation in my head. 

Something would happen or an opportunity would arise and I’d hear her say something that would tell me what to do.

This relationship broke up, and through a ridiculous turn of events I ended up losing the relationship with my mom completely for 2 1/2 years. After that, I’ve noticed that voice has completely disappeared. Now in relationships I’ll hear nothing at all, except maybe some Instagram reel advice I’ve seen or a book I’ve read or something that relates- but I’m going in blind. It’s very strange. 

I’ve not seen anyone else on the internet talk about this, maybe it’s completely insane…. But I’m curious if anyone else has ever experienced it.
