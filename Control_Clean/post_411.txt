Still happens to this day
I know that I look foreign to a lot of people. Almost every single time I go out to a store or public place, people stare at me, both men and women, from every age group and it starts to make me nervous. I have been told that I look Mediterranean European to Arab, to Persian, to Turk, and even once I was government sanctioned as Black by the State of Oklahoma on my Driver License. I should have kept that license instead of returning it back to have it corrected after a friend pointed it out almost 2 hours after I had received it.
