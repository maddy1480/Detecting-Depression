"A Chinese Takeaway"
I feel like my world has completely collapsed after learning what a British "Chinese Takeaway" is.

I've never seen something so horrendous in my life. How do you conquer half the world for their spices, and use none of them.

And it's not the fault of the restaurant owners in the slightest, they're having to pander to people that legit cannot handle food with any sort of flavor. Why is everything Grey or beige. What the fuck is curry sauce.

This is causing an existential crisis because while most American Chinese absolutely isn't authentic, its loosely based off of dishes from Chinese immigrants. I could go to a McDonald's down the road from me and order a 10 piece meal and get the equivalent of a British Chinese takeaway
