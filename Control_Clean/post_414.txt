Does your height affect you in everyday life?
Does your height affect you in everyday life? As a tall woman 6'8", I constantly have to think about certain things. Ex avoid hitting your head on things or hitting things with your legs or being able to fit in smaller spaces. I usually also have to think about not being intimidating for others which affects social life.Does it have any effect on you in everyday life or work or when you play sports or in your home. For me my height is something I am reminded of every day but I've gotten used to it so it's fine. however, I am interested in whether others think about their height.
