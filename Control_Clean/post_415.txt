Anyone else find it discouraging to be void of any passions or hobbies?
I yearn for a passion in any particular hobby but I can not seem to hold on to any for very long. I feel like perhaps sucking at something and being a perfectionist is what mainly gets in the way of that, not too sure. Nonetheless, I hope one day this can all change.
