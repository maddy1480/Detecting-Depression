I don't want to make new friends.
Does that make sense? Like I'm ok with the friends I have and if I lose them, I won't be making an effort making new ones. 
I do a lot of social activities (hikes, book clubs and so on) but I do them solely because I actually enjoy these things, I don't want to make new friends or connections or whatever out of them. I want to do my hike and then go home. Read an interesting book, discuss it and then leave. I'm not there to make friends. People are exhausting.
