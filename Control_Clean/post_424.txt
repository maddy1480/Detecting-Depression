Missing a crush
I (27f) had a crush on a classmate (26m) in my cohort for as long as I knew of his existence. We didn't have many conversations, but idk I feel like I'm in love with him. I do think he liked me back, we definitely flirted.

We had trouble communicating, for a number of reasons, and it was always like our timing was off. Now we've both graduated and I can't stop thinking about him. 

I have no idea how to get in touch with him. I'm just missing him and sad, I wish I could go back and do things differently. 

Anyone else go through something like this? Here to chat!
