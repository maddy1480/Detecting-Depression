Colleague at work got hurt by my comments in the past
I just got to know that one of my work colleagues got hurt by few tongue-in-cheek and humorous comments I made a few months back when we worked closely together. These comments were made in a group setting. Her friend told me that she was deeply affected by them. She had voiced her displeasure once or twice but I didn't think too much back then as I thought I was engaging in light banter.

I talked to a friend and he says that this colleage of mine is being overly sensitive. I am not sure what to do now. Should I talk to her about it? We still are part of the same wider team even though our projects are no longer the same and hence, we do not interact much these days.
