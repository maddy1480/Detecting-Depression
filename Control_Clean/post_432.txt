I don't understand the appeal of the Moomins (but am open to anyone explaining it to me)
With me for a limited time is an 'inter-library loan object' of the first volume of the original (newspaper comic (?)) run of Swedish speaking Finnish author Tove Jannson's 'Moomins'.

I'll admit that my opinion might come in part b/c I'm not enjoying the non-renewable book as much as I can in only a week but I still don't get it. (For lack of a better word) goofy hippo crossed with benign troll looking creatures get into shinanangans akin to what the characters from Arthur or old Disney shorts might go through in a setting with characters of other kinds, in stories with an aesthetic akin to a much less action-centric bucolic One piece with the mildness of old children picture books.

:I I can understand how a person might like it at least a bit, but I don't really understand how it would've been enough to cling on for decades to meme-riffic levels of popularity and even overlap with anime.

Please help me understand, if you can.
