Tipping Culture Is Getting Way Out Of Hand
I saw a news post a while back that self-checkout machines are now asking customers to tip. When I saw that I thought it couldn’t be true until just yesterday I saw this happen at a self-checkout machine at an ice cream shop that was asking for a 10%-20% tip. Absolutely ridiculous! Why do I have to tip a machine when I’m doing all of the work lol? It’s unbelievable how much extra profit businesses these days try to milk out of customers. Times are tough with inflation already and it’s insane expecting customers to still pay even more on top of that. 

I’ve also been seeing this at fast food places where the cashiers have tip jars in front of them and ask for tips after taking your order. Just seems like people want extra compensation for stuff they’re supposed to be doing anyways. That’s literally your job! At the rate we’re going wouldn’t be surprised if you’ll have to tip someone after opening the door for you too. Tipping is a choice. Not an obligation. Bosses are the ones who should be paying their employees a decent wage instead of expecting customers to make up the difference. 

I don’t mind tipping when the server goes above and beyond and is extremely attentive. But tipping a machine and expecting a tip for doing the bare minimum and doing what you’re supposed to be doing anyways is simply unreasonable.
