With NPR and PBS leaving Twitter, I would like to announce my departure from Reddit
I won't be leaving just yet. The next iteration of social media that will combine and replace all current models has yet to be created by AI but it will be done. I'm exited for it and just waiting for beta to come out so I can jump ship. It's been a pleasure! and hope to see you all there! :)
