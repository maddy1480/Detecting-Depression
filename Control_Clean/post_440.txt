What are your experiences when you left your parent's house?
I accepted a great work opportunity very far from home. At least 15 hours in flights. Now I'm living alone for the first time and even though I feel happy with this choice 90% of the time, solitude does gets to you sometimes, besides the fact that now I decide everything in my life. I want you people to share your experiences even if it is not related to mine at all, how did you react and how where the upcoming years after you left your parent's house?
