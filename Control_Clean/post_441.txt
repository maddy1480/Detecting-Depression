I loved school lunch.
I grew up dirt poor where most times our family meal consisted of cabbage soup, rice, and (if we're fortunate) fried eggs. My family were refugees and we came to the US in 1988. When I started going to school, I was under a free lunch program where I received free breakfast and lunch. I loved going to school for those very reasons.

In the morning, I'd get a small carton of chocolate milk, French Toast sticks with a cup of syrup, imitation screamed eggs, and a sausage paddy. For lunch, a small carton of chocolate milk, sometimes a cup of juice, rectangle pizza, a side of fries, and a square of fudge. I loved it. These were the highlights of my week. Come weekend, I knew it was back to cabbage soup...
