Some of you artists who like to draw big monsters I’m asking you to remove dinosaurs from your brain. Now that this has been done how would you rank/review a trex’s creature design, lets say as an alien predator?
You don’t really have to read any of this you can just answer the question in the title. Just context and some more info/ questions.

I was looking at a post of someone asking which dinosaur movie they should watch and thinking about how often trex is portrayed as more of a monster than a real animal that existed. Then I was thinking about like if it didn’t have the added cool factor of it actually existing at one point, how would people see it.

So are trex looking animals inherently cool or are they only cool because they invoke the idea of a huge predator that actually walked the earth? If some other type of predator than giant therapods reached that size on land and were as well documented as trex would monster hunter have copied them just as much?

Do evolution’s top predators inherently look cool as fuck because they evolved to be really good at killing stuff and that  makes us respect their power? Or is stuff that evolved to be really good at killing stuff always gonna look cool as fuck cause big claws, teeth and muscles?

Or is just an animal with such a powerful jaw that it’s tiny ass arms don’t make it less scary is in itself cool as fuck?
