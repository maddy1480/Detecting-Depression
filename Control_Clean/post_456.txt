I’m grateful my parents taught me it’s okay to cry.
This a bit of a long, random, and probably unimportant story but I was having a conversation with a few co-workers the other day where I asked if they’ve seen Guardians of the Galaxy 3 yet. We’ll call them Dave and Chip. Both had said no but planned on it. I told them it’s a really good but sad movie and they might cry towards the end (I sure as hell did). Both had laughed saying that wouldn’t and that it would be “gay”. I mentioned that there was nothing wrong with letting a cry out, even if it’s once in a blue moon. Dave replied saying “I’m pretty sure there is something wrong with it” while laughing and chip agreed. I didn’t really too much of it and just moved on to the next random topic that day. Earlier today though, I had a rough day at work and school and just let out a good cry. After, it made me realize how appreciative I am that my parents not only said it was okay, but encouraged my siblings and I to express our emotions. Even if it’s something minor like listening to a song, I don’t stop myself from letting the water works come out. A lot of the times, which I can only assume is the case with my co-workers, it’s the parents or the environment around them that has scolded them or made it seem “weak” for men to express their emotions. In a way, I sympathize for those who were raised on that stigma and had/continue to go through things and having to “stand tall and be a man”. Holding in your emotions, I feel, can only make things more stressful or difficult to truly process especially when it comes to things like grieving. Obviously, everyone’s different but  there’s nothing wrong with crying and it doesn’t make anyone less of a person. I don’t know, this was just a late night thought and wanted to jot down my thoughts lol.

TL;DR - I’m glad my parents taught me to express my emotions and those who don’t could benefit from it.
