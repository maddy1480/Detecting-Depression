I'm trying to get back into reading again, any recommendations?
I've recently found my old Diary of a Wimpy Kid books and really enjoyed rereading and finishing it again. Now I just kinda missed being able to finish reading a book.

I'd prefer something light to read since I'm just easing myself back into this. Does anyone have any recommendations? 

Preferably fiction, and I wouldn't mind a bit of romance. Anthologies would be nice too.
