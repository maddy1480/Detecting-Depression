I identified clips of a song from 2 different movies and I think it’s cool
To get it out there, Jerry Maguire is my favorite movie of all time. During the “You had me at hello scene” there  is a song playing in the background while the women’s group is going on.

At first I thought it was just score or tones  done for the movie and not an actual song until I heard it in the movie Air. I can’t find the link for it, however, it is toward the end when Matt Damon gets a phone call from Chris Tucker (keeping it spoiler free). And as Matt Damon is looking into the distance, I heard the same notes! I put together that it must actually be a song.

I Shazamed it and the song is called “Through The Hill” by Andy Partridge.

This is big news for me because I always loved the background music on that scene but I never thought to look it up until I heard it on Air. Now I can listen to it whenever I want!
