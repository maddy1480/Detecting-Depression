I just saw something on my "minds eye" for the first time and it was awesome
It was so realistic it's like it was right in front of me. I was coming out of a also paralysis episode which i think contributed to it since hallucinations can accompany those(auditory in my case)

But after breaking out of that when I closed my eyes I could *see*.  Like was watching TV or something images, pictures, some not even of real things. 

Then I opened my eyes and it disappeared 

Now that it's gone it just reminds so much more about the dark emptiness when I close my eyes and try to imagine something
