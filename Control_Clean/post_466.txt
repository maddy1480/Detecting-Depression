I regret selling my xbox
I had my Xbox one X with 1tb hard drive listed on FB marketplace for $150 and sold it for $100.   I regret letting it go for so little. I priced it that way because I felt $150 was a fair value as it is about half of what everyone else is selling it for.  I feel like I made a huge mistake accepting $100, it's not like I was desperate for money and I do have a use for it. I tried buying it back but he refused. 

Should I offer more money? Or how do I live with what I feel like was a massively poor decision?
