Despite many things, I love the midwest
Even though there's a lot of downsides to being here, especially when you're queer and "different" seeming, I can't let go of my fondness for this place. I love how intense the seasons are, how nice the open prairie is in the morning. When I can hear meadowlarks and red winged blackbirds sing near the lake where I grew up. The people here are a mixed bag, but when you meet the right people and form a bond, they will do anything to help out. I like the wide streets and silly, overblown state football pride everyone has. I've experienced alot of isolation and judgement here, but I've also had alot of love, too. I'll probably leave in the next year or two, but I won't forget! 

Midwest folks, what do you guys like about it here?
