I didn’t cave in and buy a hoodie that was too long for me
I am maturing. I saw this hoodie I loved but it was way too long for my short ass. Normally in the past I would’ve bought it anyway because I really didn’t care if my clothes fit me or not because I hated my body anyway (if that makes sense). Now, I’m starting to look for clothes that actually fit and compliment my body. It’s actually a pretty major success of mine. I just wanted to share this and hope someone understands.
