How do I make friends similar to me without disregarding my bestie?
Don’t get me wrong, I have a few very amazing friends, one of whom I have known since the fourth grade (currently in high-school), and she is my best friend. The problem is, I’m not very similar with any of them. 

Growing up I was always a bit weird. I liked ghosts, video games, dresses, old cars, and shoes. One day I’d be dressing up in pink dresses and heels, the next day I’d spend locked in front of my TV holding an x-box controller. Do I sound hard to be friends with? Yeah, I know. Trust me, I spent years feeling like I had to chose one side or the other, but I’m over that now. 

I’ve excepted that I need separate friend groups. On one hand I want a group of girls I can dress up with, we could put on bikinis and go to the beach, spend hours getting our nails done, etc. But on the other hand I want a group where we can meet up and work on cool old cars, play video games all night, or play football in the park til it’s too late and dark to see. And, somewhere in between, I want someone I can meet up with Sunday afternoons and walk to the graveyard, tour haunted buildings and play with Ouija boards. 

My best friend falls in none if these, but I truly believe it is impossible for me to find a better friend. I’m not looking to replace her, I wouldn’t dream of it and I love her more than life, but I need other friends too. As much as I wish she was interested in anything I just named, she isn’t. 

So, am I asking too much? Will I just never have friends with all the same interests as me? How would I even meet people like this? Also, I feel like it’s an important note that I am also currently in therapy for social anxiety, so just talking to people isn’t easy for me.

Sorry that this turned into a bit of a rant, but I would love anyone’s opinion.
