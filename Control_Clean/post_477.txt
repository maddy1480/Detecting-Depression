Feel guilty about slacking on my college work, and going on a vacation.
My first year of college was a covid year where i couldnt get the hang of anything, thus ended up with really terrible scores. Last semester, i really pulled up my socks and worked hard. The results arent out yet but i feel like i gave it my all. 

This semester, is going by in a jiffy due to summer break and delay in college opening after sem exam. Everything needs to be done at home well coz college will try to blaze past the material as fast as possible. If i am to do well, i need to get it together and do what i did last sem. Again. I am so tired. I want to enjoy hobbies worry free. And before ik my study methods have worked i dont even want to get into that rigorous mode again. I have lost so much motivation. And being swamped by event (like farewell or my birthday or close friends birthday) isnt helping. Ik whats up with the syllabus and books, which is more than i did in the first year, but i couldnt write a test now. I really haven't gotten much done. My father has noticed this lathergy and we had a big fight about it. While i fough, deep down ik he is right.

Now we are going on vacation next week and coming back 1st June. Its after 4 years (reason:covid again), the whole family is excited. I picked the destination. But chances are mid June will be exams and i dont know what to do. I feel guilty but i dont wanna take the guilt on vacation with me. It sucks to know when some things are your fault but you dont wanna be rude to yourself but also know you deserve a spanking.
