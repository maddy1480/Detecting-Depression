This universe is about Duality
I think this universe is about Duality (to be and not to be, left and right, up and down, etc. ). That means 2 clearly defined states and everything between them. I was wondering if I got it wrong and maybe there could be also 3 defined states, and I just don't understand it. I don't think quantum states between those dual states, like a probability of 50% that SchrÃ¶dinger's cat is alive, are equal to the duality of being 100% alive or 100% dead, and at the same time I feel very ignorant. Basically, I am trying to imagine a universe based on duality+1 and I am failing ðŸ™ƒ
