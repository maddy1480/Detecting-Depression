What does "want" actually mean to you?
I get into these thought loops ever once in a while, and now I'm pondering what it actually means to want something. Let's say that I feel like smoking a cigarette, but I refrain because it's unhealthy. Does that mean that I actually *want* to do it, but I just withhold myself?

It seems to me that in order to want something, both of the following conditions must be met:

* A *desire* to do something
* An *intent* to do it, or taking any action towards fulfilling the desire.

It is also possible to intend to do something without any desire to. Going to work for example, it's something we sometimes don't have any desire to do, yet we intend to do it, and we actually go through with it. Clearly, on those days, we don't *want* to go to work, or?

Let me know what you think of this whole thing!
