How do you cope when watching horror/thriller movies?
I just finished watching M3GAN and around the end when it started to become creepy I took out my unloaded airsoft gun (dont want to blow a hole in my screen) and whenever I saw the antagonist I would pretend that I'd be shooting them and it does wonders.  


It makes me feel like  
1. It's a movie and I can step out at any time.  
2. I have some sort of power over the antagonist, in M3GAN I would have the firepower advantage and hence they're not a concern.  
3. It gives me something to do instead of freak out.  


What other coping methods do ya'll have?
