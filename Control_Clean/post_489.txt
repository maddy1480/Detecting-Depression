Comfort Shows
Has anyone ever tried to start a new show to watch but only ending up watching your comfort shows? For me, I try to look for something interesting to watch but I just end up going back to watch either The Simpsons, King of the Hill, Family Guy, South Park, My Name is Earl, and Raising Hope.

I did manage to finish a couple of new shows that friends have recommended to me like Cowboy Bebop and Clone High but after that I just going back to my regular shows that I watch..

Though I have got back to rewatching Fargo and also finishing up One Punch Man.

Anyone else do that?
