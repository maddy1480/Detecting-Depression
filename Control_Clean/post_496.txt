Insurance approved my medication for my autoimmune disease that I’ve been without for a year!!!
I found myself without access to my immunosuppressant medication in 2022 and have been beaten black and blue by my illness for an entire year.   

After 10+ ER visits, countless nights of pain and tears from being unable to digest anything, and eventually having to quit my job, I am going to have my medication again. I might have lost my 25th year to that, but 26 is going to be so much better now that I’ll be out of pain.   

My hell is over!!! I’m going to feel better again!!! I’m too relieved to care about anything else today. 

Also Fuck Crohn’s disease and the American healthcare system
