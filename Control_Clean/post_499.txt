Man-spreading
Watching a discussion on ’man-spreading’ on tv this morning reminded me of an incident that happened on London Underground when I worked in London early 90s.
While travelling from work on the tube a man sat next to me (M40ish at that time) and did the usual‘inadequate alpha male’ act of spreading his legs as wide as possible. After several minutes of his leg pushing mine aside I lifted my leg, put it over his, rested my hand on his lower arm and my head on his shoulder.
He pushed me away and shouted “what the f**k you doing freak?”.
I looked up at his eyes and answered, in my sweetest voice “well I thought you were coming on to me darling and you’re such a sweet looking young man I couldn’t resist “.
He stood up for the rest of the 15-20 minutes to his stop.
For anyone now wondering about me, I’m a straight, ex-military dude with a (very) wicked sense of humour.
