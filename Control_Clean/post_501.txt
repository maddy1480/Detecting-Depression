When someone looks at you with so much affection that it overwhelms you
Today I met up with my friend for coffee and we were trauma bonding as usual (along with more casual topics of course) and when I was once again talking about my own struggles with my family, I looked up from the table and just saw how she looked at me with such a warm affection in her eyes that it overwhelmed me. I had to look away for a second. 
Because I always have this ugly voice in the back of my head who tells me I‘m boring, whiny and a burden to everyone around me. Sometimes I feel the urge to tell people I have just befriended not to feel burdened to meet up with me. 
And now just a few minutes ago I received this text from her:

„By the way, it felt so good to finally see you again“.

So to all my homies who fight with low self esteem issues: try to look at yourself with your friend‘s eyes from time to time. Chances are they see you in a warmer light than you do
