I know itâ€™s not the most exciting news, but I turned 20 today.
I honestly never thought Iâ€™d make it to this age. Iâ€™m proud of where I am today and what Iâ€™ve accomplished. my bf made a cake for me which was super nice of him. Just wanted to share this little hurrah on the internet. Hope everyone has had a good day/night so far!

Edit-thank you for all the love and support! It means the world to meðŸ˜„
