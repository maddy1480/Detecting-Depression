My theory when I comes to superpower
If you really think about it all superpowers magic etc is divided into 4 category of where the powers come from and what it affects and 5 sub category,

The four category is physical mental spiritual and abstract

Physical is obviously the ability that is tied to physical things like the super strength control over physical material powers that comes from things like DNA and even the ability to control physical laws

Mental are your psychic abiltiy your precog your telepathy any power that involves the mind

Spiritual is the powers that involves your soul things like energy like ki in dragon Ball things like ghost abiltiy and all that stuff

And abstract is the power that deal with abstract concepts like time cause and effect probability reality warping powers and all that,

Then there is 5 sub category of how those powers function

Produce the ability to create conjure or cause something to happen

Eliminate the ability to remove or reduce something

Alter the ability to change something transmutation and the ability to transform is a part of this sub category teleportation also counts as an alterer ability since teleporting is when you change your location

Controller the abiltiy to control something

And included the ability to induce or insert something into others like inducing a blessing to someone or even the ability to induce thing to yourself for example being able to read minds is where you induce the thoughts of others into your mind or stealing other people's power is when you induce or put their powers into you

I believe that almost All powers on fiction is based on these category

Telekinesis? Mental controller
Teleportation? Physical alterer
Power bestowal? A inducer ability
Healing power? Physical eliminator it eliminates damage
Energy ball? Physical or spiritual producer
