A month off instagram makes me feel so happy about life
It’s such a small and stupid thing, but it made a big difference for me. A month ago I decided to stop spending so much time on instagram. I used to post regularly and upload stories - it was all so natural and just part of my social life I guess. Sometimes I would scroll for hours and end up looking at someone’s profile that I have never met before, never will meet and honestly don’t care about. So I turned off the notifications and stopped showing up there. The only time I use it is to post my art now. But I don’t even look at who liked it, who commented on it. I just post and get out of there. 
Being off it for a month made me realize how terrible it made me feel. I would subconsciously compare myself with everyone and their circumstances. I thought that they are better than me in every way possible. Now I enjoy life much more. I feel much more connected to reality which is so different from what people portray on instagram. 
I didn’t quit earlier because I was afraid I will miss out on things and opportunities. I thought I will lose a connection to friends. But really - i am way more connected to my friends and life now. I do things because I enjoy doing them. Not because I want to post about it. I’m also more productive and overall more happy.
