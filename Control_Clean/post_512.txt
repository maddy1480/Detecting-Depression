I just beat high school at 22 years old today
I graduate in 6 days. 

Today I received the notification that all my high school credits were completed. The suspense was real, I honestly didn’t think I could do it. Over the years I dropped out of high school twice, but in 2022 I enrolled into an online program that would get me across the academic finish line. Now I just have to fly to the school location and graduate then I’m finished. I don’t really know what to do after this, I’m just glad it’s finally over. Maybe I’ll try to get a better job or something.
