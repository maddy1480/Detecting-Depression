numbers are so toxic
the moment i can’t post on social media due to not having the content, engagement tanks.

and then of course i can’t help but look at the numbers go down, i can’t help but look at the views and likes desperately hoping they’ll skyrocket. 

why can’t my content be shown to my followers normally, why am i not allowed to take breaks and return with our being punished.
