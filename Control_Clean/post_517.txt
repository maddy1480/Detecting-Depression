I don't fit anywhere anymore
I moved when I was 18. Absolutely hated it at first. When I visited my hometown it felt like I didn't fit in anymore. Realised I actually loved my new city. 

It's been 5 years. Most of my friends have left both my home town and my second city. The ones who stayed was because of boyfriends or girlfriends. I don't feel like I'm happy here anymore.

I don't want to move to an entirely new city because I won't know anyone and I find it really difficult to make new friends. Most adults are closest with their childhood friends/old university groups/colleagues/boyfriends group.
