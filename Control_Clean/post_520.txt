Is it okay to wear the wrong color cap and gown for high school graduation?
Instead of cashing out $150 for a cap and gown, my parents ordered a simple black cap and gown from amazon. Turns out, my schools decided to have boys wear black gowns, and girls wear gold. (I am a girl). My  is ignoring my emails, and I've been wondering, should I skip my graduation, or show up in black despite being a girl? I'll stand out, and feel awkward about this whole scenario
