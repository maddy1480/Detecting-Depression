Why some people just don’t bother to apologize?
Everyone makes mistakes. Sometimes people point out to me, sometimes I realize it later on. But I always make sure that I apologize to the person once I realize it.

But a lot of people don’t bother to say sorry at all. Don’t they care? Or their ego is too big to accept their fault? 

An apology ofc can’t correct the wrongdoing but it would at least make me feel better that they hold themselves accountable for it, that they felt bad and thought about my feelings. Few people in my life have disrespected me so much, blindsided me, left me alone. These people were no strangers, they were people with whom I had genuine connection with. 

I still miss them a lot and if they would just reach out to me today I would happily accept them back in my life.
