Broke the snap streak now I'm feeling guilty
Hello! I am not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but I just wanted to clear some clouds about the Snap Streak in Snapchat. 

So I'm relatively new to Snapchat and I met a very good friend of mine who's been using snapchat for a while (she has 200,000 scores or something last time i checked). So we were exchanging snap a lot and we were at a 4 days snapstreak (by that time I did not know what it means) so I asked her and she replied it's a streak that increases snap score.
So I felt a little heartbroken cause I felt like being used to increase her snap score (I do not care about my snap score at all) so I left her on 'read' after a couple of more snap exchanges. But we still talk on Instagram and IRL like nothing happened.

But it's bugging me that if it was rude to break the streak for thinking something so stupid.
