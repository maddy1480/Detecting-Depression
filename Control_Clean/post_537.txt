I wanna be more social but I don't like how I feel when I open up.
Been thinking about talking more in situations where I normally don't talk so I can improve my small talk skills. For example, Im not a big fan off talking at the barbershop, but when I do I feel like I don't have control of the conversation or im not saying anything funny or interesting. Feel like my small talk skills lead me into boring conversations or into a conversation where I feel venerable and lack control. I come out not liking who I came out as when im finished talking. Any small talk experts have any advice on this.
