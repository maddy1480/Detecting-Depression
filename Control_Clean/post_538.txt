I wasn't really thanked for a big work project and it's got me feeling down
So, took on the lead on a big project which I would normally never do but we were down a staff member (they planned to rehire but it was taking a while). So, I went over-and-above for this project - had a lot of help but I was still the one responsible for it.

Project finishes and my boss just gives a vague "thanks team" at the staff meeting. Doesn't mention me/talk about how I stepped up. Yes, my boss did some extra work too but that's her role.

So a couple of days later, still feeling rubbish about it. Don't want to confront my boss as I'll come off as being dramatic and "complement fishing". But I would really have liked to be recognised for that work; my close workmate was surprised I wasn't.
