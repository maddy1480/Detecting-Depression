Wedding scenes
I've seen wedding scenes in so many movies, by the dozens, and it never gets boring. The crowd seated, the bride and bridegroom, the white dress, the veil, the walk up to the altar, here comes the bride, the best man, the maid of honour, bridesmaids, I do, you may kiss the bride.  Everything. Never gets boring. But I've only seen it all in movies.  I wonder how it feels like to be one in the crowd, or to be the bridesmaid, or even the bride. Tell me about your wedding experience.  How did it feel? Was it as exciting as it feels when I watch it on TV? Any interesting wedding story you want to share? Or maybe there are other different wedding rituals? Different kind of weddings? What movie do you remember that had a wedding scene in it?  Mine is The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 2.  Saw that movie again yesterday.  Ofcourse, Four weddings and a funeral.  My best friend's wedding.
