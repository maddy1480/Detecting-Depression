What are you the best at?
I was feeling down about my academic abilities and the fact that as hard as I try, there will always be someone who does better on that test, has the higher gpa, and is overall academically smarter than I am. So to get out of this headspace, I started to try and think of some random things I am really good at. I genuinely think that I am potentially the best “I Love Hue” player (it’s a game I have in my phone where you sort color based on hue). So I want to hear you what you guys think you are the best at. If there was a championship for this specific thing, you would take gold. It doesn’t have to be extraordinary, the more niche and unique the better!  Brag and be prideful lol
