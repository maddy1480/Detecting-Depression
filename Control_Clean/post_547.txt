Just deactivated twitter
Recently, I started being more active on Twitter and saw a sudden increase in followers. Sometimes I got in these back to back arguments with people on things that were not particularly arguable to begin with. 

I posted a reply to a tweet and saw how many people visited my Twitter account as a result of the reply. It gave me so much anxiety. 

In the middle of a back to back conversation, I realized I couldn’t workout. I was busy looking at what people were doing. It’s like being a hamster on a wheel. 

It got so anxiety inducing even though there was nothing too negative. Just the adrenaline of being on a public platform made me feel very bad. I felt like I was getting more attention than I could handle for tweets. 

Just a few months ago if I tweeted something no one would even bother looking at it. I forgot that things are different now. 

I feel relief deactivating, but even now find myself wondering what people think about the fact that the account was deleted…

It’s so nerve wracking. Everything on social media stays permanent. 

I need a nice long break to reset myself.
