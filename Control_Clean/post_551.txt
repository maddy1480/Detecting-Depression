Sometimes I think I may need therapy for this.
I get a little jealous admittedly and insecure when I see a ton of attractive women around me. I am what some may consider “conventionally attractive” however, I get reallllllly jealous (not malicious) and will convince myself I’m not good enough when around others. Last night I met the nicest and damn fine man at a hotel casino as he was waiting on his gambling friends and I was waiting on my gambling aunt. I was sitting in this little waiting nook and he walked in and we sat there and talked for two hours. At one point during the convo these model-like beautiful girls walk past us and I instantly felt so ugly and just not good enough, definitely a little self-loathing. I’m a huge hype girl so even when I do see someone who is beautiful or dressed nice I immediately compliment them but, anyone ever deal with my rendition of a first world problem? How do y’all deal? TY in advance.
