I just watched my 3rd computer die
I had literally just reinstalled Linux, and was watching some YouTube when all of the sudden Firefox closed and wouldn't start up again, and all my icons disappeared. When I restarted it wouldn't boot, and when I tried reinstalling I got a faulty hard drive error. It was actually a little bit satisfying knowing my computer has a "full life", and died gracefully. Have you ever had something similar happen, where you just had a computer die as you were using it.
