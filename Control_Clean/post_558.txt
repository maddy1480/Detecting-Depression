I’m flying for the first time and I’m terrified
I have never been on a plane, not even a small, domestic one. Now I have to take a pretty long 40 hour flight to the other side of the world, moving permanently, alone. I don’t even know how to get my boarding pass. Yeah, I watched some tutorials and got an idea of how things work, but it doesn’t make things feel any less alien. It’s a pretty big change for me, and I’m pretty excited, but terrified at the same time by the journey I need to take.

Edit: I got lots and lots of tips and advices to make this easier from you all. If Reddit was a bar, I’d be buying you all a round of drinks on me. Thanks fellow redditors.
