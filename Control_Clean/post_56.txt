my friend is buying me a ton of stuff, should i be worried?
i'm a girl under 18 and i have an online friend who's over 18. the age gap isn't a problem for me because he's just a friend. we both have very similar maturity levels and views so its super eash to get along with him. he's been spending quite a bit of money on me recently because he says that my goals that i've shared with him are super inspirational and he wants me to be successful in my future unlike he once. because we both went through similar things in our childhood and he doesn't want me turning out like him basically. so he's getting me things that make me happy that i'm not able to get from my parents. he bought me books, snacks, and he's asking to order me some delivery this weekend. my friends say to be careful in case he's yk a pedo. and i know my boundaires and if he crosses them i will cut it off with him. i don't care how much money he spent on me. but should i tell him to stop spending money? i've never had any friends buy me anything before so i don't know if its normal or not, personally i just really appreciate it. but i would like some other perspectives :)
