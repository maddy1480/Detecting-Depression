Blacksmithing and its viability as a hobby for Indians
I absolutely do not know where to put this, so here it is. I'm from India, and I went into a youtube rabbit hole yesterday. Blacksmithing looks like something that would give me so much peace! Sadly, there's no classes, forges, or anything at all available in Delhi, where I stay. One of the busiest cities in the whole wide world, you'd think it would have something for everyone, but lo and behold here we are. All the forges have been turned into welding shops, so there's no way I can craft anything whatsoever now. Pertinent to note here would be the fact that I'm piss fucking poor and the only thing I can afford is an Amazon wishlist of all the materials required for learning blacksmithing, and boy am I glad that wishlists are free. Anyway so yeah. That. Felt like sharing, don't know where I should go from here.
