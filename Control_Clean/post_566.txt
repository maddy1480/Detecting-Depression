Who wants to hear some low stakes petty drama??
**EDIT: UPDATE added to the bottom so as not to spoil anything!**

I'm writing this on a throwaway and changing a few minor details because this is very much ongoing and it involves people in my community.  I don't want anything happening to them, I just NEED to tell someone.

I'm in a local Buy Nothing group on FB. For those of you who don't know, it's a great organization/movement where people in a neighborhood post free stuff they want to give away and a bunch of people can ask for it. The "winner" is usually chosen at random. It's a wonderful way to reduce trash and save money (depending on the item), and it also builds a nice sense of community.  I highly recommend it.

Buy Nothing has an app as well as FB groups dedicated to each neighborhood. I don't like FB at all, but older folks are much more likely to go on FB than the app... and older folks are the ones with $$$ and better Give items.

In my particular group, there are two very active members. I'll call them Rosemary and Thyme. Judging from their photos and the fact that they are CONSTANTLY posting on the FB group, I assume they're both retired/not working.

Rosemary might be a hoarder. She comments "i would love to receive this item. thank u." under literally every single post.  A bag of clothes for an infant? A life-sized cardboard cutout of Levar Burton?  Half a skateboard with a lewd painting of a crocodile on it? Doesn't matter. Rosemary wants it.  Now, when someone gets chosen to receive an item, there is usually a short conversation through FB chat to discuss how/where they will pick up the item. For the longest time I thought Rosemary was a bot because the way she talks (plus the sheer speed/frequency of her comments) has zero personality.  Most people will say something along the lines of "ty so much my daughter will love this :)" but Rosemary just gave me "ok" "yes" "thank u" type responses.  However, she is indeed a real flesh and blood human with very bot-like tendencies. Rosemary rarely posts Gives herself.

Thyme, on the other hand, is a very social participant.  She will comment on almost every post as well but with things like "Comment only: What a beautiful give <3 <3 <3" She gives and receives at about the normal rate, but she clearly likes the community aspect of this group the most. Thyme is generally beloved in the group, but she did get banned a few times for engaging in very heated political arguments in the comments section (very much against the rules and completely unrelated to the item/post it was under).  To be fair, she never STARTS the arguments. She just cannot help herself when she sees a Trump fan or anyone posting right-leaning sentiments.  Many people have told her to stop feeding the trolls and that it's very distracting, but I don't think she's really taken it to heart.

Now... onto today's main topic. Last week I posted some clothing items to give away.  They're all in great condition and are from reputable brands but I just wanted to change my style.  Clothing is an interesting give because it really limits the pool of people who can ask for it (gender, style, size) but it gets VERY competitive for people who meet the criteria and want the clothes because it's like this rare gem of a Give.  Per usual, Rosemary wanted the items.  She is a taller woman in retirement age and I'm a short woman in my late 20's.  I can't imagine her wearing anything I'm about to give, but whatever.  This time, Thyme also wanted the same items because she wanted to gift it to her granddaughter.  She wrote me a long thing about how this is exactly her style and she has been DYING to wear some of these brands but she couldn't afford it.

My policy is to choose a random name but give a little favoritism for people who are in need, people who have a very very good reason for wanting the item, and people who haven't received anything from me yet.  I just weigh the scale a little in their favor (and sometimes they still don't end up getting the item).  I planned to do the same here.  Since Rosemary has received several items from me already and Thyme gave me a compelling reason, I would look at Thyme a little bit more favorably.

As I was about to draw the name out of a hat, I got a DM from Thyme.

"Please do NOT give those beautiful clothes to Rosemary!!!!! She is an awful person!!!!!"

Ooooohhhh.......?????? Do I smell some drama?

I didn't want to stir up any kind of bad feelings, so I gave her a polite but casual response about how I know she receives a lot of items in this group so I will take that into consideration when making my decision. THEN Thyme writes...

"Not only that....she stole my bf!!! That woman is a SNAKE."

WHAT.

&#x200B;

I'll post an update in a couple of hours because it is about to get JUICY and is still ongoing.

Would love to hear y'all's thoughts on this situation so far! My friends aren't really interested for some reason and I'm dying to talk about this with people!!!!

&#x200B;

**UPDATE/CHAPTER 2:**

I responded to Thyme's FB message with just a "???" because I truly did't know how to respond.  She clearly wants to tell me something but this is such a weird message from someone I barely know.

Thyme proceeds to send me PARAGRAPHS of backstory (bless). I'm going to TL;DR below:

\- Thyme is a retired divorcee who has gotten close with a younger man she met in a local activist group... let's call him Chad.

\- By younger... I mean mid-30's.

\- What Thyme describes as "close" is lots of texting about the activist group's activities, occasionally meeting up for coffee.  This does not scream "dating" to me but she thinks differently.

\- She recently found out that Chad is doing the same thing with Rosemary even though Rosemary is not in their activist group.  Thyme, for whatever reason, thinks Rosemary approached Chad because of personal reasons between her and Thyme??? Not sure on this one..

Honestly, this just sounds like Chad treating both Rosemary and Thyme like sweet old grannies in his community but I, of course, don't say that to Thyme.  Being a non-committal instigator, I just reply with "Wow that's crazy... Thanks for letting me know! I'll definitely keep that in mind!"

Now, Rosemary and I are also in a separate local FB group involving a niche hobby. Let's say.. underwater basket weaving.  I'm only mildly involved in this one and have never attended IRL get-togethers but Rosemary seems to attend their events frequently (just judging from the photos).  For the first time, I click "Yes" to their next group event.

Fast forward to the weekend event for Local Underwater Basket Weavers Unite. Rosemary is there. On her arm is a much younger hipster dude with a slight dad bod.  Imagine that cute tatted up barista from your local organic pricey coffee shop. He's got rolled up sleeves and suspenders.

She has her arm hooked around his elbow like she's being escorted by him at a nice event. They are acting quite "couple-y" but not like... openly smooching or anything. My jaw is on the floor and my mind is RACING.

Typically I am super shy but the tea MUST be spilled.  I go up to Rosemary, introduce myself, and make casual talk about how we've spoken on the BN group.  I then turn my attention to her man and shake his hand.

"Hi, I'm Chad. Nice to meet you."

Ding ding ding.

I take a gamble and go "Oh, hey, I think I've heard about you from Thyme! You're both in that activist group, right??"

Chad just nods and go "Oh yeah, I know her! She's great!"

I look over at Rosemary and she is NOT. HAPPY.  I poke the hornet's nest further. "Rosemary, you know her from the BN group too, right?"  I have never felt bolder in my life.  My heart is pounding.

Rosemary sighs and goes "Yeah. I know her."

Sensing that she'll close off if I go any further, I change the subject to our niche hobby and the nature of the conversation instantly becomes lighter and happier.  Chad is cool as a cucumber and the mentioning of Thyme doesn't affect him at all.

I have to go eat dinner so TO BE CONTINUED.

**UPDATE/CHAPTER 3:**  

I break off from Chad and Rosemary to mingle with the other underwater basket weaving folks. Unfortunately I'm not super active in this group so I don't know too many people. I do eventually run into someone I sort of know and chat them up.  I then decide to take a chance and ask them if there's a feud between Rosemary and Thyme involving Chad.  This person looks a little confused and responds "I think Chad is a bit too young for either of them and I saw Thyme with her husband just a couple days ago so I don't think there's anything going on there."

ANOTHER TWIST. 

In my FB messages, Thyme had made herself out to sound like a long-time divorcee who was just sick and tired of being lonely...  but now that I go back and read it, she doesn't necessarily tell me WHEN she got divorced.  I do think she's still lying, though, because she was apparently still married to her husband "a couple days ago". 

I decided to give my clothing (from my original BN post) to Thyme in the hopes of getting more info out of her. This is probably my most unethical recipient choice so far lol. As penance I will give more from my closet in the upcoming days. 

When I messaged her about pick-up, I wrote "Hi... I'm sorry this all happened to you. I saw Rosemary and Chad at a different event the other day :( How did she steal him from you???" 

Thyme then wrote back a looooong response about how she got to know Chad through the BN group. It sounds like he just messaged her out of the blue and they got close pretty quickly.  Thyme said she had been feeling very lonely for quite some time and Chad told her he felt the same way.  She secretly confided in Rosemary that she was getting involved with a much younger man and how exciting this all was for her and Rosemary encouraged her to go for it. I guess they were friends before all this??? 

This is when Thyme wrote that she is "all but separated from her asshole husband but it's a matter of time".... so not divorced.  It didn't sound like they were swingers and it certainly sounded like she wanted to keep this whole Chad thing a secret. Whatevs, I don't know their relationship.  A few months after Thyme got together with Chad, she noticed that Rosemary had essentially started ghosting/ignoring her.  THEN she found out that Chad and Rosemary were "together" even though Chad was still "talking" with Thyme regularly. 

&#x200B;

HOLY POPCORN, BATMAN!!!! I am eating this shit up. Unfortunately, this is as far as I am at this point.  I'm hoping I can get more info out of her after she receives the clothes for her granddaughter. 

It's also important to note that I looked at Thyme's FB page and only 2 weeks ago, Thyme posted a photo of her and her husband smiling on vacation with the caption "Happy Birthday to the best husband and father in the world <3 <3 <3"

Hopefully I can update again with more later but this is it for now!!! Thank you for reading! :)
