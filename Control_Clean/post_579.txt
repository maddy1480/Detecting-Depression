I hate pooping
It’s so annoying and tedious, I just hate it so much. And then to have to sit there and wipe a bunch so ur ass doesn’t sting and stink later on is extra annoying. Like wtf evolution, let me pop a squat, push and move on. I hate it has to be a whole 30 min endeavor. And don’t get me started on IBS like wtf now your intestines just DONT WORK??? But you need to use them every day this is so annoying oh my god
