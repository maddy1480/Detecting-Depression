What are the strongest memories you have from your school days, good or bad?
Still etched in my memory is the end of school performance that would customarily be given when we left secondary school at 16. For our year we did a dance and miming performance from "Greece". Everyone participated, and did a little routine in the spotlight on stage, in costume, and as a boy of that age I found it utterly humiliating. No particular reason why - we had a whole year to get through so I was only on stage for a few seconds. Based on the awkward and robotic movements of quite a few others (mainly other boys), I don't think I was the only one!
