Classic movies
This is for older redditors..

Does it make laugh or cry when u see a movie from the 70's 80's or 90's now called a classic movie? The other day on a classic movie stream. I watched T2 yikes am I that old? I remember going to the picture show and seeing it on the big screen. Made me laugh. There are others.. what's ur take on making of a classic. Mine are movies like Gone with the wind. Westside Story ( not the remake) wizard of oz.
