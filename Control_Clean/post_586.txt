I've never been on vacation and the concept of it is almost alien to me.
Growing up, my family was neither poor nor rich. We didn't travel or go on vacations. Sometimes in the summer we would spend a day at a local beach or go to the movies. School vacations were spent sleeping late and hanging out with the other kids in the neighborhood.

Now as an adult, I am poor. I make just enough to live on my own but I can't spend money on anything for enjoyment. I have to save up for the next big crisis, whether it be medical bills, dental work, or random car repairs. Whenever those things happen, they deplete my savings. I use my paid time off to spend a week sleeping all day in my apartment and binging tv shows.

So I guess what I'm wondering is what's it like to actually go on vacation? If you're traveling for a week how do you actually spend your time? I feel like if I actually went somewhere on vacation, I would spend the time stressing about all the money being spent on non-essentials.
