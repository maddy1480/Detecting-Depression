I have what's called Kaleidoscope Vision.
It's a visual disturbance where you have rainbow-ish vision, fractures in light and images, auras, geometric patterns, photopsia (flashing lights), and lots of tiny fast moving dots. Also, sometimes I see things that look like small iridescent whirlpools  I don't have all of these symptoms at the same time all the time. I do however experience rainbow-ish vision and tiny fast moving dots like a broken tv 24/7. 
It looks very pretty but it's so annoying and concerning. It comes in episodes, and I notice it the most when I'm in a bright room or looking at the sky. Typically this is accompanied by pain but I don't have that symptom. 
My doctors still don't know what the source of this is. Nothing is physically wrong with my eyes and a neurologist found nothing concerning in my brain scan.
