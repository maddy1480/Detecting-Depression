Am I “leveling up” too fast? My tastes for vacations and lifestyle have changed ever since my honeymoon. Am I spoiled or too posh?
I don’t know where to post this but maybe here I could get some advise. went on a luxurious hmoon as well as another really nice vacation and ever since then, I am barely tolerating lower quality things. Recently I went on a cruise vacation and I could tell from the vibe, quality of food, service, party atmosphere etc that it’s just not for me. I did enjoy parts of it but i know how I really felt about certain things. My partner feels the same way and we are afraid we are “leveling up” too fast. 

The problem is that we are not rich by any means, i.e. we make low six figures each of us but have six figures in student debt too. We are renting and have 1 car.

Our lifestyle has changed too, buying quality things over quantity that will last us longer. We are fairly conscious with our money too, budget and track expenses.

Are we forever doomed in that we can’t “enjoy” life, due to this? Since we are not rich but have good tastes in things, but we can’t realistically live like this sustainably. Has anyone experienced anything like this? I also don’t know what this is called. Are there communities here or somewhere of people that are similar? We are introverts, no partying, enjoy dinners and going out and having nice experiences.
