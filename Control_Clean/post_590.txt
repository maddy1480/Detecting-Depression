I just found out about this game and was so surprised how accurate it is to my life right now
I've never really enjoyed PC games before. All I had was a Tamagotchi pet but you only had to occasionally take care of it and it only takes a few clicks. I had downtime today and figured to look for a game to properly play cause I was bored. After looking, I got really curious about this game called Stardew Valley. It's a pixel game which reminded me of Tamagotchi but colored so I bought it and loaded it up, of course, having no idea what it's going to be like. 

The intro played and I was so surprised at how much its premise mirrored my life so much that I got goosebumps. I, too, was sick of the quick life in the city and then suddenly, I inherited this farm from my grandparents so after graduation, I moved out of the city to a small rural farm town to take care of it. 

There are a few differences though. The farm itself is not as large as the one in Stardew and we focus on chickens to sell eggs and a bit of vegetables and fruits. My grandparents are still alive but they just wanted to pass it on to me so they and my mom can guide me so I won't make awful mistakes. Also it's a landlocked town so there's no fishing here. No caves, no mining, no magicians and no monsters as well. But I mean that's kinda obvious haha

Makes me wonder, are there also games you've played with stories that's eerily similar to your life? I'm really curious to know!
