Pls discuss what is some good english songs to sing in a karaoke lounge that does NOT repeat the chorus like 10 times?!
If you look at other music like Kpop or mandarin songs ; at most , they sing the chorus only twice... In american music; they sing the chorus at least 3-4 times.. Isnt that boring as hell for the singer?   
Pls discuss.
