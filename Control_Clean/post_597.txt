This is my 40th year of playing video games
I am not sure whether that is interesting or not.  My first system was an Atari 2600, my favorite was probably a Nintendo 64.  I also loved the Dreamcast, but it never caught on.  I have a PS5 now, I am getting Jedi Survivor for father's day.  I have a job, I am married and have adult children.  I don't think it rotted my brain as my parent warned, but my wife is not sure.
