Flashing your car lights is an underrated form of driving communication
I have found myself flashing my bright car lights (~two taps) a lot more often than I used to. About a year ago I slowed down in the left lane to let a truck move over due to an accident up ahead and no one in front of me was letting them over. After we passed the accident they flashed their lights at me and I was confused until I saw them waving in the rearview.

Now I find myself flashing my lights for a handful of different things when driving to communicate with other drivers. Someone trying to get over and you made space? Flash your lights to let them know they have space. Car in front of you forgot to turn their lights on and are driving in the dark right now? Flash your lights. Pedestrians wondering if you they have your attention when trying to cross the crosswalk? Car across from you in a 4-way intersection get there first but haven't moved? I think you get the point. I wouldn't say I do this all the time, and I mainly use it to let trucks know they have space to merge, but I feel like it is an incredibly useful tool more people should use.

With that said, please don't use your bright lights to flash someone to go faster.
