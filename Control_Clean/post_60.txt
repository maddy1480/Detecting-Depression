I have the PSAT today
I feel like the title is all I need to say to express my feelings of drear. Fortunately, it’s merely the (P)SAT so it doesn’t count for much. However, I still like to try my hardest on these sorts of things. Because of that, does anyone have any advice? I’m a slow test taker so it being a timed test isn’t good for me. Any wisdom on how to pick up the pace a bit? 
To cure my feelings of immense boredom (and slight anxiety,) does anyone have any fun stories to share about their own testing experiences?
