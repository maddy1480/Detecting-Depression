Do you have a nice story or memory involving rain?
As the title asks, do you have a nice precious memory that you hold onto that involves rain? Perhaps a rainy day at your grandparents' where something nice happens? Or how you and a friend/sibling sighted an awesome thunderstrike when looking outside the window?

A personal memory of mine is from a few years back in my second year in University. Usually, to go to my university, my dad drops me off at the bus station in the morning, and I take the bus from there. And to go back home It's more of a hassle, because I usually have to take two buses or two trains.

This one day, my dad drops me off in the morning, and it's a very rainy day. He tells me he'll wait for me in case the buses aren't working because of the streets flooding, so I go and check the buses at the stop and indeed, they are not running for that day. The rain was very heavy, but I had an umbrella, and so ran back to the car and managed to get back in dry. Then dad said he'll probably not go to work either, and so we decided to just drive back home. I had just gotten a new phone at the time, and I was happy about it, as it was my first smartphone, and I was fiddling with it and playing a certain type of brickbreaker game. I felt very cozy in my father's car, as the rain outside poured nonstop, and as we were stuck in traffic. 

Probably not a very nice memory for my dad cause he hates traffic, and nothing really stands out about it as a story either. But something feels right about that memory. It felt like I was at a really good place in life.
