Are you kinda glad that you don't have any friends?
I used to have some friends who I had nice conversations with until we suddenly argue over some misunderstandings I unintentionally created on social media in the past. Therefore, they gave up on me and never texted me again. Not only that, but I realized that there are people out there who complain, threaten to hurt, or yell at others because they're that bitter and unhappy to ruin a good atmosphere for people. I shouldn't let that get to me, but it's really hard to forget about it sometimes. 

That's why I think that I don't need any friends. Turns out that I can be happy without them and do the things I love. And that I should love myself, but it was a bit hard to do at times knowing that people out there might complain and throw a hissy fit for some reason. Yeah, we thought friends are supposed to care for and help us whenever we need it? Pfffft. Looks like others don't have those qualities to make our lives easier. They just choose to be difficult. And they can piss off for all I care. I guess now would be a great time for me to enjoy nyself even though I've been in bed for like 3 years now.

So how about you? Are you glad that you don't have any friends yourself so you can revel in your peace?
