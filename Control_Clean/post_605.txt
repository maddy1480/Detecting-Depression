Dancing makes me high
I’ve been a very reserved person all my life, and that includes my body being frigid while I control every movement of my body and facial expressions. It’s been very hard to express myself, but I’ve recently been getting this strange urge to dance and even though I tried to deny myself, dancing makes me feel so good. I’m still embarrassed to dance alone in my own bedroom lol, but whenever I indulge (which is now becoming very often) I feel high during and after a dance. I think it’s because I love music so much and I’ve denied expressing myself for so long, but dancing makes me feel amazing.

(Side note lmao-it kind of made me think of that scene in Avatar the Last Airbender where Aang teaches the fire nation about dancing and they lose all their “inhibitions”)
