I have to do a graduation speech in my graduation ceremony!
Iâ€™m a senior in high school and in one month Iâ€™m finally going to graduate, Iâ€™ve never been the type to give speeches in-front of so many people, especially in such important events, but my teacher suggested that i give a speech and said that she trusts me , I really do think that i might screw it up and maybe make it the worst memory ðŸ˜­ but thereâ€™s a small voice inside me telling me to go for it , i even nearly fought with my best friend because she wants me to do it but Iâ€™m still scared , i donâ€™t know what to do , Iâ€™m not even confident enough to post this but ig i just need support?
