People don't hate change, they hate the lack of control
People have no problem with change as long as they are the reason for the change, because that usually means they are the one making the changes and are in control. That said, people do not like when other people make changes though because they are usually not in control of that change. Once they find their own control or sense of stability in the change that happened, they adapt and the change becomes acceptable, even though they may still feel upset about the lack of control. Change is good or bad depending on the observer, not the change itself.
