My inner monologue is pissed off and I don't know why
Over the last year it seems like my inner voice has become much more negative and outwardly pissed off towards others. I used to be really positive and accepting and wanting to help other people and now someone looks at me the wrong way and I want to lash out at them. My inner voice swears a lot now, it sees everything in a negative viewpoint and has become quite aggressive. I wish it would stop, more importantly I don't know when or why it started, it's just getting worse over time. It's making me feel like an awful negative aggressive person, even if I keep it all inside and don't say any of these things out loud. I don't want to become a grumpy cynical person who thinks negative of every thing and situation. It really isn't who I feel I am and do not want to keep going like this but I don't know what to do to honestly change.
