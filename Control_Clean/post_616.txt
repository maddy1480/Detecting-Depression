Having a cold in the summer is the worst.
It's currently 10:30PM, I spent the last few days with a stuffed nose having to blow it very often, and a bit of a stomach ache. I still went to work today... but I don't feel like going tomorrow although I took many free days last month already...  
I'm not sure if I can get through tomorrow at work and I'm just making excuses to not go because I'm lazy and probably not that satisfied with work (it's an Help Desk job and i'm already there 2 years, kinda my first job) and that frustrates me.  


Also I just watched a video about quarter-life crisis and I could relate :\\  
thanks for reading :P <3
