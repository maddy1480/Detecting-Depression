What iOS/Android games are y’all addicted to right now?
Not a console gamer but I love playing games on my phone. My tastes are varied. I can do puzzle ones, simulators, story games, you name it I’ll check it out. I’m just not a fan of games that heavily rely on in-app purchases. What are y’all playing right now?
