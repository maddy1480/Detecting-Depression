It was around two weeks ago but a ladybug landed on me and it felt like a such a nice moment
I was determined to have a nice morning and wanting to appreciate the nicer weather and sunnier days. I don’t know if it’s just who I am around, but it seems most popular for people to say they like the winter the most and reference the sun being not out as longer. But I thrive for sunny days, and it was a really nice sunny day. 

I don’t like summer as much, but aside from fall spring is when I think I feel the most content outside. And so I went on a walk to try to appreciate the days in my life where it feels brighter. And it was just a really nice walk, and when I went to sit by the water a ladybug landed on me. There is something about a bug landing on you that isn’t for sucking your blood reasons or anything that feels … nice.

The ladybug didn’t stay long, but it made my morning a lot more enjoyable. I find wandering around like that to be when I feel the most connected to both the general world outside of cities and towns even if I’m in one (except in NYC for feeling like too much concrete) as well as other humans. 

I want to make sure to know I’m not alone, even though I feel like I still need to make more friends.
