How many of you are married or live with someone who is obsessed with Cars, but didnt know it in the beginning?
I, for one, didn't see it coming, even when it was right there in front of me LOL Maybe the first red flags were the multiple car shows we went to while dating?? Or the fact that he had different tires and rims all the time it seemed??? OR the multiple car stereo set ups (don't get me started on car audio OCD's! LOL) ...  Nieve me, didn't figure it out, till about 20 years into the marriage LOL

*Love my husband to pieces, with all of his obsessions, but I will always be a* ***Desperate Car Wife***
