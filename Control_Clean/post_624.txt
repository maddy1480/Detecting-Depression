Can we talk about tipping for carry out orders?
I struggle with this (I live in the U.S.) because years ago my parents told me you don't have to tip on carry out orders because the servers aren't waiting on you. Then during covid, businesses were struggling and people srarted tipping on carry out orders. Now covid isn't affecting businesses and I'm wondering is it rude if I stop tipping on carry out.

On lots of the bills there is an ask for a tip but I never do 20% I just do a flat 2 to 3 dollars despite how much food I ordered. Is 2 dollars too little/disrespectful? Do I even have to tip? 

Thank you for helping
