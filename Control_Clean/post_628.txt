Happy Mother's Day to all you amazing Mom's today.
Giving birth, raising a child, keeping them safe...an incredibly tough (and sometimes heartbreaking) job.  What makes it worthwhile is the incredible love you feel for your child.  Even though said children may give you a hard time, forget your birthday, ignore Mother's Day, or are just clueless on how much you gave of yourself raising them.  Children who can be so self-involved at times that it doesn't even occur to them that others have feelings as well.    I want you to know that I see you, I know what you have sacrificed, the tears you have shed.  I know your worth and I appreciate you. :)
