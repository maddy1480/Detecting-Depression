I realized something about drawing.
I’ve always been into art and drawing. For the most part, I draw portraits and faces. When I was younger and but a fledgling, I always memorized little tips and tricks to make my art look good and realistic. But as I’ve gotten older and had more chance to study faces, I’ve learned something. The best way to get good at drawing realistically is to understand what you’re drawing. If you’re drawing a face, you need to understand where the bones are, and the muscles, and whatnot. You need to know about every tiny protrusion on a face to properly shade it and make it look dynamic. You can’t just know where to put and shade lines, you have to understand why you’re doing it. Realizing that has made me a much better artist.
I’ve always told myself, an artist is someone who’s able to see life and recreate it. You can’t do that if you’re not seeing life fully.
