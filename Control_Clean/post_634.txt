If the most beautiful woman in the world was to write a book about her experiences, what do you imagine would be in it?
Recently read My Body by Emily Ratajkowski and it made me think that although Emily is an incredibly beautiful woman, what kind of extreme experiences would be faced by a woman of even more extreme beauty?  
In your imagination, what would be the experiences faced by the most beautiful woman in the world?
