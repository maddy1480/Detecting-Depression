I bought The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and I'm hoping to finish it by the end of the year.
I only finished Breath of the Wild because I got COVID in 2020 and put 100 hours into it while I was laid up in bed, and I won't have 5 weeks of doing nothing for this game. Even though I absolutely loved it, and have loved every Zelda game I've played, I kept telling myself not to buy the new one because I just don't have the time. What's the point of buying a game that'll just sit there collecting dust?


Then I walked into Costco, saw the display for the game and just said, 'Fuck it." So what if it takes me forever to finish? I'm not on a timeline, and the joy is in playing, not just in finishing. Just because I have a lot to do doesn't mean I can't make time for a bit of joy. Anyway, I'm only an hour into the game so I've better get to it.
