Some people are just so kind, to no benefit of their own. I admire those people.
Someone posted on here a while ago about a compliment they received that made their year, and it made me think of a time someone did the same for me. I’ve thought of this instance every now and then since. 
A couple years ago, I worked a night shift and rode public transportation alone to and from work almost everyday. Very often, I would be verbally harassed by men who believed they were “complimenting” me. At times, even physically assaulted. That being said, I had a lot of anxiety while riding the train.
One particular time, a man tried getting my attention only to tell me he thought I was beautiful, and he hoped I had a great day that day, then promptly turned and walked off the train, never to be seen again. Such a simple act of kindness, but I’ve never had someone do something like this for me ever.
I was so shocked, all I said was thank you very sheepishly. I hope he at least heard me. To this day I’m thankful for his compliment, and the fact he took the time out of his day to say that to me. I admire people who can be so sweet with no want or expectation of anything in return. 
I hope to spread positivity to others more often, and be more like that man that shared his kindness with me.

Edit: added TLDR. 

TLDR: I received a compliment years ago that still brightens my day even now, and motivates me to create the same positivity in other peoples lives!
