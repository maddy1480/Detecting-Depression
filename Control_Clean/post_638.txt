I passed my classes with flying colours!!!
So I just got the results of my exams ... And for the first time in a long time... I aced them!!!

I had  prepared really really hard this year and I cleared my exams with the highest scores in my class!! 

I just feel sooo happy that all the work paid off. I really was doubting myself if would be able to do it and here we are. And just as I was starting to think that maybe I should have not taken it so seriously and should hv done what all of my friends did and just relax, here we are. And see my family soo happy and my satisfaction just decided that I will continue to work hard.

Sorry for boring your ears off ( if ur still reading this) but I am soo haaapppyðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„

Edit : thank you soo much for you wishes!!
