After over 20 years, I've finally reached that stage in life where I'm done with being overweight.

I'm a 6 foot male in my early thirties, and I've been overweight since I was about 12 years old. 

It all started back when I started secondary school. I wasn't a very confident kid and going to "big school" didn't go down well... Combine using food as a way to feel "better", with a fear of exercise through lack of confidence, I ended up a bit of a chubby kid. Not huge... just chubby. 

Fast forward a few years, and once I hit university I started getting bigger. Nights out every weekend consuming a frightening amount of calories in alcohol and end-of-night stodge; eating and snacking out more now that I'm earning a weekend job wage; it all added up, and by my early 20's I was over 20 stone (280lb). 

Late twenties I peaked at about 22 stone (308lb). Looking at photographs back then, I really did look unhealthily fat. I almost look like a different person. I think seeing that has helped me not go back there, but I'm stuck at about 20 stone now and have been for a while.

Last year I got down to about 18.5 stone - the lowest I'd been for over 10 years probably. And I felt great. I was proud of myself, I looked better, and I generally felt better day-to-day. And the best thing was that I was doing it gradually through simple daily changes that I enjoyed... I was snacking less; eating smaller portions, tracking my eating, and exercising by walking each day for a minimum of 30 minutes.  

Unfortunately, last summer I had a bit of a "health episode" (unrelated to weight) which saw me in hospital for a couple of weeks. That really did knock me back. The good routines that I'd gotten into had gone, and I just didn't have the willpower in me for months that followed. 

I'm getting "back on it" again now. In recent weeks I've been doing a little more exercise between work  and parenting, and I've been eating healthier again too. My biggest issue at the moment is snacking! Especially in the evening when we're chilling together in front of the TV. It's a bad habit that I need to get out of, but I'll get there. 

Anyway, as of 30 minutes ago, my weight is 20 stone 4 (284lb). My goals are: 

* By the end of July before I go on holiday, I want to be 19 stone (266lb). That gives me just over 11 weeks to lose 18lbs. Just over 1.5lb a week. I think that's achievable!
* By the end of the year I want to be 17 stone (238lb). That works out at about 1lb a week. I think that is very achievable, and I'm hoping to exceed that!

I've never spoken about weight loss with friends and family before. In all honesty, I'm embarrassed about it and kind of feel ashamed. Hence the anonymous Reddit profile as a way of "talking" to people for the first time. I'm hoping this approach works and helps me. In the past, the only person I've spoken to about weight loss and my goals is myself in my own head!

So why am I doing it?

* I'm just fed up of falling into the overweight category. 
* I want to feel better. I don't know what it feels like to not be overweight. 
* I don't regret anything because I have a great life, but I know that there are many opportunities that I've missed out on over the years due to my weight and due to its impact on my confidence. I want to stop missing out on those opportunities. 
* I want to look better. And fit more comfortably into clothing. 
* I want to be more confident in myself. I think being overweight sometimes keeps me back in generally interacting with people, in some aspects at work, and so on...
* There are many other reasons that pop into my head from time-to-time too. 

How am I going to do it?

* Smaller portions at mealtimes. 
* Healthier meals. (We generally eat healthily for the most part anyway at home, so just increasing that more.)
* Reduction in snacks! (I need to get out of this bad habit in the evenings!!!)
* Walking daily. 
* General increase in physical activity throughout the home. (Exercise bike; dumbbells)

I guess you guys don't really need to know all this. I've never "spoken" about it before (I know, I'm not actually speaking here...), but being able to get this down on virtual paper I'm hoping will help with my motivation and willpower. Ultimately, enough is enough now and I'm ready...

If anybody got this far and has any advice or words of encouragement, or any personal accounts on what has worked (or is currently working) for you, then go for it!

Thanks people of Reddit!

Edit: I haven’t replied to all, but I’ve read all of your responses and I’m blown away at how great you all are. Thank you for the encouragement. I’m gonna do this!
