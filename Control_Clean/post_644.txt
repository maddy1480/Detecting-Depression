I finished getting my GED today
I took my last two tests today and scored really high! And I like to believe it’s because I had my crystals in my pocket. 

I had amethyst for memory
Tigers eye for success and luck
And citrine for a little extra luck boost. 

Yeah I’m a crystal person lol believe what you want but I genuinely believe in the energy crystals and intentions have.

Anyway yeah, now it’s time to get a job and be an adult haha.
