My friends made plans in front of me
My friends and I were watching eurovision together, I'll admit that I don't usually watch because I always work during those days eurovision is on TV. Suddenly they are making plans to go see the final live next years and dosent invite me because I don't know anything about it and wouldn't understand their thing. But, really, in front of me? While we're watching it together? :')
