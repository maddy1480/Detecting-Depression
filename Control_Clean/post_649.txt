Birthdays during the Summers.
Hello all! It's my birthday today. I'm not here to get attention during my day but do y'all hate it when your birthdays fall during the summer?

With climate change catching up and the temperatures soaring higher everyday, me living in India from a not so well-to-do family (without ACs, we have coolers) in our homes it's so annoying to wake up everyday with sweat all over your bodies and I usually wake up with my boxers turned into a thin hardboard due to the salt and the sweat accumulated.

It's terrible but really, I'm just gonna ask people to wish me a happy birthday during the winters now, these summer birthdays are not worth it. Any thoughts? I just wanted to come rant here lmao.
