At what age and how did you realise that your friends are moving on with their lives and it was not the same as before?
If you want to, you can also share what were your feelings during that time and how you dealt with it.

Why I'm asking this question - As someone who's always had a lot of friends and tried to stay in touch with all of them (multiple schoolls, neighbourhood, college, work) and now I'm 25, its slowly coming to realisation that people are more formal now when you talk to them (most of them). And some people who you used to have deep conversations with won't even reply to your messages.

I admit sometimes I'm on the other side of the line, where I'm the one who's changed. So I accept that this is the reality. So just trying to ask people how they went though this phase and how they dealt with this change..
