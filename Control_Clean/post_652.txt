My niece was born recently, what steps should I take to become the “cool uncle” in the future?
I have 3 brothers, 2 step-brothers and 1 sister. My sister is the one who just had a baby. As you can see the competition for being the “cool uncle” is pretty fierce. Both my parents are the only child in their respective families so I have no cool uncle as a reference. 

What do I need to do to be the cool uncle?
