Moving from Virginia to Eugene Oregon in just a couple days.
My mom got a fancy new job out there and they're relocating us. It's been quite the experience packing up everything, throwing even more away, and preparing to pull up our roots.

I've moved around a lot but this one feels significant, I've been on the East Coast for so long. The lions share of my family is in New Jersey and it's very intimidating to confront moving so far away from them.

Ive got no idea what I'm gonna do in Oregon, and that's a difficult thing to think about in all the chaos of moving.

Despite all that apprehension, I am really very excited to get over there. I like what I hear about the state, I think I'm going to do well there.

I don't have a point that I'm getting to, just an anticlimactic last sentence about how this is all just a stream of consciousness I wanted to dump somewhere.
