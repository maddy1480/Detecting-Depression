I know a girl who doesn’t own a phone and has no access to the internet.
Both of her parents are computer engineers and when she had first told me, I was like damn your life must be boring, but it’s actually quite the opposite, they travel a lot, they go out and see new places a lot. She’s very intelligent and occupies herself with books all of the time. It’s very impressive how well adjusted of a Human she is, her and I are both in the same engineering class. I wish I had the discipline to get rid of my phone for like maybe 3 months and just live life like her.
