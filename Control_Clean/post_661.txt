What's the best response that doesn't make me sound I'm avoiding them?
So basically sometimes I just don't feel like talking to anyone but some of my friends sends messages, I just tell them I'm busy or don't have the time, but they soon start to ask if they did something wrong or I'm avoiding them.

Is there a good response that won't make me sound I'm avoiding them?
