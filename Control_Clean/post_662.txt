is life is different how i used to view or did it change?
whenever i see some of the photos i feel the urge to feel like that again(i dont know)is it nostalgia fever or what because it makes me feel peaceful and how i used to be when i was child.whenever just a ray of sunshine makes me wanna go back. ik i explained weirdly because i too even dont know.

can i feel like that again (even in slightest) or should i move on?
