I got an awesome compliment from my girl, I think.
My soon-to-be-wife was almost unconscious, asleep but asked me to get her water. I brought the glass next to her and she just said "thanks, you're so hot that you could turn on a tv" and fell asleep.

I laughed my ass off. Best compliment I've ever gotten. And as a dude you don't get these so often. Altho I'm not sure if it's compliment or some sort of roast. Anybody can turn on a tv, and its the most mundane thing couples can do. Well, she said I'm hot so I'll take that.

I'm not sure if this is a quote from somewhere or if my girl is a comedic genius. Anyways I love her.

Just needed to share this to somebody, so the internet it is.
