I love hearing people talk to me, But i don't really enjoy talking.
I hate small talk but I enjoy conversations but when im listening to others they sometimes point out that i dont really talk that much. 

When I to try to talk I just don't know what to add because i end up Stuggling to think of ways to put my thoughts into words so they end up waiting for me to speak but then i lose my words so it just gets awkward.

I sometimes try to speak but i end up enjoying hearing the other person's story its just more fun to listen than to talk than for me to speak

Does anyone also relate?
