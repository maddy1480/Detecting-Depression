Just landed my first corporate job and I feel overwhelmed and anxious about it. Advice and words of wisdom are welcome.
Hi guys,

I just accepted a job offer today and will be starting my first day on the upcoming Monday. This is going to be my first corporate (office) job in my life and also the first that I will be paid a salary as opposed to hourly wages. Honestly, I am anxious about many things;from losing the freedom that I previously had as now I will be working in the box at a desk for 8 hrs a day doing repetitive tasks (my new company is a law firm) unlike what I was doing before (I was a teacher/tutor at a daycare/after school center, so I had a pretty flexible schedule and multiple engaging activities).

Honestly, I just feel like letting it out. I already talked to people in my close circle and they assured me that I will be fine. I know I will be able to excel in my role but it's just the sense of uncomfortable that comes with an entirely new setting and also the feeling like going back to school again since high school doing 40 hours a week in a LED-lid space. Thanks everyone in advance for reading all the way here. I hope you all have a great day/night.
