Im spending my night at polish E.R. how's your fraiday going?
Bicycle accident. My drunked friends foot landed inside bycycle wheel. (She was riding on the buck while some dude we met earlier was "stearing". They crashed and her heel looked real real but. Fortunetely there was retired firefighter driving by and helped a lot. So now im bored waiting for something but she seems fine. I can hear her laugh at the back.
