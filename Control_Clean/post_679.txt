Have you ever gotten several hours into a video game and then suddenly remember/accidentally use a very basic mechanic that would’ve totally enhanced your experience and made everything a million times easier instead of the long-winded way you’ve been doing it?
I got 5 hours into Metroid dread before remembering I had a melee attack. Got so annoyed I just started the game over again just so I could do it properly this time
