Got a new cat recently as a companion to accompany my resident cat but it isn't going well so far :(
Screwed up big time when we first brought a new 2 year old cat to our house and brought her to our room however did not realize our resident cat - 6 year old was under the bed (very rarely does he go under the bed therefore we didn't check - but nonetheless it's still definitely my fault for not checking). So I only noticed when I noticed our new cat was staring under the bed and being very still. Looked under and there was our resident cat, staring back intensely ðŸ˜­ Carried him up and out of the room but it was too late, he started hissing at her ðŸ˜­

The next few days we constantly shared each other furs to both. Continue giving the same love to our resident cat but he upon a few days in, he started to hiss at me. Sigh. Gave him his favourite treats but once finished, he goes and hides away. So I gave him some time to calm himself while still continuing to transfer stuff of the new cat to him and vice versa. 

I know it takes time, it's been 2 weeks since and at times he still hisses at me (I now wash my hands to erase the new cat smell before touching him) or hides away (preventing me to play/pet with him). 

Also have started letting both of them switch places to smell each other scents in their allocated rooms but so far I do not see much improvement :(

I just hope, even if it takes some time, they can be friends or just be casual acquaintance at least. 

Initially thought it wouldn't be that hard or at least wouldnt get hissed as often as they both have the same habits and all but I guess cats are very territorial and maybe we have spoiled our resident cat? 

But I guess 1 good thing is, my new cat is now very comfy at home although probably due to this, our resident cat feels threatened and therefore is angry at me for thinking I'm planning to replace him? 

*They are still kept separately

Was wondering has any idea what else I can do?
