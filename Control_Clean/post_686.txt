Do people randomly talk to you?
I noticed something totally crazy recently—strangers just don’t approach me. Totally thought this was normal until I started walking around with my tall, friendly looking friend. For some reason, strangers will ask him stuff and engage?? Which is absolutely insane to me. 

My gender is a bit visually ambiguous—are people less inclined to talk to women or people whose gender they can’t identify? Is it because I’m short? I don’t really look down when I walk or anything—I constantly look straight up and will make eye contact with people willingly if they’re unnerving. 

What is this?? This is so insane to me. I actually don’t mind not being approached but woah, walking with others is like entering an alien planet.
