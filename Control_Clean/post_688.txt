Recent Cast Removal and Care
So about 2 and a half months ago, I broke my ankle. Had to have a cast on.

2 and a half weeks again I went to the hospital for a check up and for it to be removed. They didn’t do an x-ray and asked how long since the accident and wearing a cast. I said 2 months.

They said they’d remove the cast, then I could go home. That’s it.

Once the cast is off, I felt pain, partly cause my foots been stuck in the same position for 2 months, partly cause I broke my ankle 2 months ago.

Anyway, I started wearing a boot because I had family visiting.

However on 3 separate days…13 days ago, 7 days ago, and yesterday.

All these times with a minimum of 5-10 minutes of walking my foot gets swollen. I can’t wear normal shoes.

The only difference from yesterday compared to previous times is my ankle had no pain before the swelling, for the first time I was about to move my foot about with no pain. But now I get sharp pains in my foot.

Any advice?
