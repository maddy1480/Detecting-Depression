I don't enjoy watching Thriller shows anymore
Every thriller series now focuses on a mutli-season model and the result is a very unsatisfactory season finale. Ideally, the story should conclude in the finale and then there can be a tease for the next season.

But, here's how things play out... Especially for the first season of any show. 

The story seems self contained enough where it should be resolved in one season. Then the finale arrives and there is only a partial resolution and then the focus shifts to what is to come next. I feel like this is a very unsatisfactory viewing experience.
