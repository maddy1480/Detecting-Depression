Anyone ever just randomly slip into a character?
I have few characters I really like, namely Alastor from Hazbin Hotel and The Joker. Stuff like that. Sometimes, I just randomly slip into my version of the character, then stop after a bit. Sometimes I can't control it, and sometimes I do it on purpose. It mostly shows online though.

Anyone ever do this? or is it just me? And does this make me an actor in the making?
