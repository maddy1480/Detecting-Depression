Finally deleted my Facebook account
So I finally decided to get rid of my Facebook account!  
I know I probably should have done this years ago, since that awful site robbed me of so much time that would have been better spent reading, playing games or just looking out the window tbh.  
I haven't used the site in well over a year now and before that, I wasted so much time arguing with strangers over stupid things.  
I think Facebook made me a worse person (obviously it took my participation for that as well, but there is evidence that much of the effect that social media has on us is out of our own control).  
I say this, because I noticed that I get less angry now that I have not used it in 18 months. All the positive sides of FB are easily replaced by other services, so there is nothing I would miss about that damn site. If it makes me a more agreeable and happier person, then all the better!  


The funny thing is, after having read a book about how screwed up Facebook is in 2019, I should have abandoned the site back then, but I was too lazy. What really got me to finally delete my account was the fact that future employers look at job candidates' facebook accounts, even before inviting them over for a job interview. The idea that some stupid sentence I wrote in 2017 might cause a future boss to judge my character freaks me out. I guess better late than never eh?
