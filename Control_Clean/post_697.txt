Anyone feel a bit meh owning a PS5 and not really finding many appealing games?
Flooded with upgraded PS4 games I’ve already played on PS Store, and tbh not many new PS5 titles taking my interest. 

I got the new Modern Warfare, when it released and got bored after a while, for me the magic is gone with those games. 

I did get NFS unbound and it was fun but I only sank maybe 50 hours into it and didn’t go back to it. 

At the moment I just mess around in matches in WWE 2k23, I always need a mindless wrestling game with any console, it’s just house tradition. 

Got my eyes on Alien Dark Descent coming out and I might buy the Dead Space remake. 

Anyone else feel this generation so far has been a bit meh or just okay
