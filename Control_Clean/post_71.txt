People who enjoy cooking, do restaurants often disappoint you?
So before I knew how to cook, I would eat out a lot and to me it was the pinnacle of dining. But since I started living on my own, and ESPECIALLY since getting married and having a family, I've been cooking my own dishes. It's become a big hobby of mine. I love getting online and finding exciting new recipes. I have a really adventurous palate so I'll often look up cuisines I've never tried before and make dishes that sound good to me. At this point I'm not exactly chef material but I still consider myself a pretty adept cook.

The problem now is that whenever I go to a restaurant, unless it's some new type of food I haven't tried or something I can't make due to the limitations of my kitchen, I'm usually not very impressed. I'll order a dish I make at home and usually comment on how it tastes exactly like how I make it but it's twice the price, or the spices and flavors have been lessened in favor of more sweetness to satisfy the average person, so it just tastes overly sweet and bland, whereas I usually spice things up a lot more and focus on salty and savory flavors.

Has anyone else encountered the same problem? I'm not trying to sound full of myself but honestly it's hard to impress me now in restaurants.
