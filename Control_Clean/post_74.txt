Exercising After Doing So Makes Me Feel Better
I head to a gym in my hometown at least five to even six and very rarely seven days a week. And usually for an hour. I do the best to concentrate on the cardio and heart. 

Very rarely lift weights as want to keep my heart and blood streaming down my body. After I workout, I feel like I can breathe easier and move even better. 

Makes you feel relaxed and rested. Think that when you workout afterwards, you can feel much more less stress and relaxed. 

Even better when I get home, I can take a shower and really feel even much more better after sweating at the gym. Anybody feel like that?!
