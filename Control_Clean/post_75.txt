Need ideas for travel destinations post graduation!
I’m 25 and finally finishing up my bachelor’s degree this term. I have worked at a coffee shop all throughout my college education and after I graduate, I plan on working there throughout the summer so I have one last summer of flexibility before I move into a full-time position. 

I want to treat myself with a trip to another country this summer. I’m from the US and I’ve been to Canada and Mexico so I’m thinking something across the pond but I’m looking for input. My initial thought was Berlin with a couple friends. I would love to see some historical landmarks but I’d also like some fun nightlife or maybe a location with good beaches. Preferably on the affordable side as I am still just a barista atm. There’s just so much to see out there, it feels overwhelming narrowing it down.

Let me know where you guys have been and what you liked about it!
