Deciding to live in my car for time beint
It’s not a money issue. It’s an abusive home environment issue. Can’t afford to move out. 

There’s a gym across the street from the parking garage i already pay monthly for. I can maintain hygiene there. A starbucks next to there i can use the wifi for certs and interviews, etc. My work would be right there. 

I’d have to find a laundromat. I can prolly live off leftover from take outs

Am i not considering anything else?
