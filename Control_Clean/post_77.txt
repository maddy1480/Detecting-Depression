Random thought: Wouldn't it be super cool to be in a band especially without any experience?
I personally have no musical talent but music is a form of expression so whatever comes out is aaaaalll me ðŸ˜¹  
I could see myself playing a saxophone and it will probably sound horrible but it would also be so much fun ðŸ˜Š just playing away like you dont care!!  
What would yall play?? let me hear it ðŸŽ¶
