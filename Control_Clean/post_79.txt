Anyone use a flip phone when they don’t want to be bothered by social media or people.
I bought a used Alcatel Go Flip 3 off eBay for $20, & put it on a $5 plan from US Mobile, making sure to use their T-Mobile compatible sim for this model phone. So nice going on walks in the state parks, without being distracted by social media, & no one knows this number either, so people who only call when they want something, can’t bug me. This phone has my music mp3s on it & has a built in fm radio. Anyone else do the same when they want to be left alone, or want a break from social media? I’d go back to a flip phone, if I didn’t need a smartphone for work, & using apps for restaurant coupons & my bank app to deposit checks.
