I (27F) have a huge final interview and I'm SO nervous!
Never really achieved much in life. The usual burnt out gifted kid syndrome. Fell into Gaming when I was in college. Worked various jobs after, and ended up doing social media/marketing, and also got a part time Gaming related job (copywriting). Somehow, at 27, I have ended up with a chance to work for a huge and wildly popular Gaming Publisher. Yes I have worked hard over the years, but always felt like a failure anyway. Like I wasn't doing enough. 

I feel like this is my one chance to be something in life, and do something I truly love. I have made it through multiple interviews and my last one is in a few hours. My nerves are so shot that I'm literally shaking. I really hope I get this, it might sound silly but I want to make my mother proud. She supported me through Gaming even when the rest of my family judged me, and said I'm wasting my life. 

Wish me luck guys! 🙏
