Why are so many people so positive about the AI?
I am a big fan of GPT, Midjourney, ElevenLabsm etc. myself, but I think a lot of 'tech people' are overlooking the negatives.

Let's take such a simple position as Junior Coder. With AI sophisicated enough, Senior's won't need Juniors at all, the gap becomes too big and we have to fix the whole system OR Juniors learn to utilize the tools and the gap becomes so small, that the work gets devalued, leading to lower salaries, uneployment and wasted human talent . This wouldn't be such a problem if the shift was gradual, 7-10 years or maybe more. The system would easily adjust, we would create new jobs for people who lost their old. Every company is and will be able to employ AI in the nearest future. Let's take GPT-4, the cost for 1k tokens is something like 3 cents, that's nothing for what it offers. Same for ChatGPT, $20/month isn't a large of a sum in the Western countries. The only thing left, realistically, is physical work, but that excludes a lot of people, for example, some disabled persons. I'm also worried about how the less developed countries will fare, as I've said, $20 isn't that much if you're American, what if you live in Eastern Europe or in Balkans or in Asia though?

It feels like the people working for these big companies want to lead us into some utopia, which, from my point of view, is unattainable for the next 10-100 years, if at all, whilst forgetting that the CEOs they're working for look for profit. And those CEOs are forgetting that broke people can't buy things.

Overall, I really don't know what to think about this issue. I'm not even afraid to admit that I'm scared of how the future will look like. I am not opposed to technological change, but still.
