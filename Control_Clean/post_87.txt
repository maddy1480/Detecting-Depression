What kind of music do you play when you travel?
What would you listen to when the highway is wide open before you on a chilly early morning? What about a trip to the beach? Do you prefer to keep up with the latest playlist of your fave genre? 

Not music? Would anyone dare to listen to a horror audiobook while they drive at night alone? 

If you ride a bike, do you prefer the sounds of the road to music?
