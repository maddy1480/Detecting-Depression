The majority of people don't realise how common Maladaptive Daydreaming is
Many people dont even know that this condition exists! I've been doing it since the age of 4. 

For those who don't know what **Maladaptive Daydreaming** is, it's a **complex** condition that causes us to imagine very **vivid** scenarios in our minds, which also includes making our own characters that have their own personalities and more.

Alot of people don't discuss this topic because they think they're insane! But alot of people don't realise that it's a coping mechanism that our brains developed due to emotional neglect as a child. I find it so fascinating that our brains are capable of creating such vivid scenarios! Please know you're not alone if you do this too! ü§ç
