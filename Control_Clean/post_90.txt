Imagining Life Beyond Artifacts in Museums
As we walk through museums and admire the artifacts on display, it's easy to forget that these objects were once owned and used by real people. We often fail to imagine what it would have been like to live in the same world as the people who created these artifacts, to talk to them, to share their experiences. Even though we're separated by time and distance, we share commonalities with those who came before us.

It's a curious thing, really, to think about how similar we might be to those who lived hundreds or even thousands of years ago. What would it be like to sit down to a meal with someone from the 5th century or to chat with a Scottish lady from the 17th century? Despite the differences in our circumstances, there is a sense of familiarity that bridges the gap between the past and the present.

The repetitive nature of history also serves as a reminder of our connection to the past. We may be separated by centuries, but the same struggles and triumphs continue to play out in different contexts. Example. whether it's a modern woman living in the 21st century or an aristocratic lady of high English society from the past, there is a shared experience of living in a patriarchal society. Despite the differences in our lives and timelines, the struggle against sexism and the limitations placed on women is something that persists through time.

Perhaps it's through imaginative exercises like these that we can truly connect with the past beyond the artifacts we see in museums. As in the case of Outlander's Claire, who forges bonds with people from a different time through time travel, we too can form a bond with those who came before us by recognizing our commonalities and shared experiences.
