How old were you when you realized what you want to do with your life, career wise?
In a few weeks I'll be 23, and I have no idea what I want to do  in life. Currently I make enough money to comfortably pay my bills and save some money, but that's mainly because my rent is so cheap, and I can't count on it staying that way forever. But I just absolutely don't know what I want to do in life. I'm interested in coding, I've been trying to learn it in my spare time and I don't hate it but I also don't love it, I'm interested in the medical field but again I don't have an actual passion for it, I just feel lost. 

I've tried many things, I did hardwood flooring for 3 years, and while I did like it, the wear and tear on my body wasn't worth it for the abysmal pay, after that I was a correctional officer for awhile and that killed my interest in law enforcement, the 17 hour days, constantly putting up with bullshit, and I did not enjoy when I had to yell at people till I'd lose my voice.

I just don't know what to do. I'm going to keep trying to learn coding, but it's hard to stay excited about it when it's not something I have a passion for.

Ideally I'd like to do one of the obvious choices like musician or comedian since everyone I know tells me I should do standup, but I know those are longshots and to focus on something more realistic.

I would've liked to go to college but that just won't work out, I work 50 hours a week and have been off my add meds for a decade so I know i wouldn't do good at it.
