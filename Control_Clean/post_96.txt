What is the role of playing in adulthood?
I feel this is an important topic to research but there is not many discussions around it (that I found). I see adult people playing video games, sports, apps, dressing up for parties, going to escape rooms, using ice breakers and board games... But it is not clear why we think of playing in adulthood as such a secondary topic. It feels like this should be talked about more.
