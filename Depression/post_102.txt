diagnosed with MDD and then diagnosed with Bipolar
So, i was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorders by my Psychologists. But the therapy that she gave me didn't really worked, so i went to psychiatrist to get more help with meds. But, my Psychiatrist diagnose me with Bipolar. is there anyone in here who experience same thing with me who get different diagnose?

just curious, how this can be happenin
