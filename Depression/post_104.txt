depression and schizoaffective disorder (amisulpiride, quetiapine, pregabalin, piracetam, fluoxetine)
Hello everyone, I have been dealing with depression for so many years. Also, I have been diagnosed in a psychiatric hospital with schizoaffective disorder because i was in total psychosis caused by stress over my studies and family. At this moment, I take amisulpiride, piracetam, pregabalin, quetiapine, fluoxetine. I'm so mad at myself because I hate my life even tho its very good, I have a great family, a place to stay and i'm working in the restaurant. This is not what I dreamt off, I was studying french and english, have been taking a course on babysitting but I could not finish either of this bc of my mental break down. I'm so sad, nothing affects me. I think that I feel like shit bc of dopamine levels so today I started taking wellbutrin, I dont know if its a good idea. I have a really bad problems with concentration, thinking, I feel like my mind Has been ruined and I feel awful. Please help me if you can and tell me if its a good idea, I also have concerta and I think about using it. I've had enough of antypsychotics, I do not have schizoprenia or schizoaffective I think I was just in a very bad place. What should I do? I have zero motivation and energy, I do not want to read my books, I do not want to learn another language. I was do Smart and inteligent before and now I feel so stupid. Please help me if you can, I no longer no what to do):
