should i take my meds again?
i was diagnosed with depression and gad about a year ago, was also prescribed meds. i took them for about 6 months. during those 6 months a felt what could be described as euphoria and i was hyper and talkative and did a lot of things without having a worry in my mind, and then i just started to feel nothing. there was no happiness no sadness no pain no anything. i didn't feel like i was alive at all. i felt like a shell of a human without any feelings or even a brain. i got so worried that i was turning into a zombie so i stopped taking them. maybe it was just my brain playing tricks but the first day off of them, i already felt better. i could cry and watch movies and feel something. i went back to feeling very anxious and miserable but at least i was having feelings, so i was okay with it. then i just spiraled down and reached a new rock bottom. i have thought about killing myself every single day for the past 3 months. all i want to do is go to sleep. i don't talk to my family, i don't socialize with people i used to talk with, i don't enjoy things and i'm just a mess. all i do is go to work and get in bed as soon as i get home. i don't even have an appetite anymore. i have night terrors and i'm cold all the time. sometimes my mind just blanks out and i forget where i am for several minutes and the only thought going thru my brain is "walk to the beach and drown". i am very scared of what i can end up doing, but i don't want to end up admitted since i will lose my job and would really have nothing left to live for at all. so i thought i could take my medicine again? just to save myself for the next 6 months, and then see what to do when i reach that point? i would never want to feel how i felt on them again, but i don't want to end up dead. what can i do? i'm very scared and can't assure myself that i won't do anything bad. please help.
