vent about my major depressive diagnosis.
Sometimes I get this sickening feeling that I really don’t want to get better. That’s the fucked up thing about depression. I have built a comfort zone around my mental illness to the point where I’ve almost glamorized it in my own life. Like when I look at others, I want nothing but peace and healing for them, but I feel like I won’t be myself or my struggles won’t matter if I’m not actively going through depression and sh. I also feel like the only time I’m ever truly seen is when I’m talking to someone about how much I’m struggling, like it’s the only thing authentic about me. I think people often underestimate depression, because it’s not just “sadness”, it takes pieces of who you are until you’re a shell. I know there are so many people with depression who take their meds and wish to god they could just feel better, I just think that my dad abusing my mom and me as kids really fucked up my sense of peace and made me want to get worse. I think I’ve started the same pattern my dad did where my mental illness the biggest thing about me because it’s all I feel. I never wanted to be like him, and in most ways I’m not, but I feel like if I don’t get out of this toxic mindset that I need to get sicker I could potentially fall down the same path. Self harm is something that I started doing years ago to help cope with my anger and resentment but now it’s just become a means of matching my insides to my outside and I don’t know how to stop denying happiness in my life. I think in some ways I’m scared of healing because I’ve lived my life always waiting for a shoe to drop, and I found comfort in chaos. The only problem is that once my life became peaceful, I became the chaos, like I was filling a void.
