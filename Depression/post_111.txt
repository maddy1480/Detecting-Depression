The only friend who knows about my depression diagnosis is “jealous” of it… I’ll never open up to anyone again
You’re probably wondering how someone could be jealous of a depression diagnosis… well in the recent years among people of my generation mental illness has become nothing more than a quirky personality trait. Having depression doesn’t just mean being sad, but no one cares to understand that. 

I opened up to my closest friend after a lot of hesitation and I was first and foremost met with bullshit. Not a thought of empathy, nothing of that sort. Instead they said that if they had been evaluated they would have scored so much higher than me. What kind of answer is that? What has to go through a persons brain to think this is the best thing to say in a situation like this? 

Coming back to the title of the post, this person has shown many times that they want to have depression. Keep in mind, not wishing to receive a formal diagnosis for a problem that they may have, but actual desire to have a mental illness. It’s hard to express through a post, but irl their behavior makes it obvious that they think being sad sometimes = depression. And to top it off they keep making jokes calling their sadness ‘depression’ around me, just like people who say they are OCD when they are just organized. 

Do people ever think before talking? I’m not even expecting empathy, but damn I’ll definitely never talk to anyone about my depression ever again
