It’s been 6 months since my diagnosis
First post on here, I’ve been officially diagnosed for 6 months, it’s gotten bad lately but I haven’t had any meds prescribed to me yet. Therapist told me it’s because it might worsen it instead of making it better since I’m still relatively young. I just want to get somewhat better now just like give me more reasons to live and be happy.
