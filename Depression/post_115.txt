My PHQ-9 Has gone down
I scored a 18 in june, today I had a session with my psychiatrist where she administered the test again and I went down to a 6. She has me on Sertralin 50 mg and half a tablet of Lamotrigine 100mg. I'm feeling so hopeful, I haven't fought with anyone in a month, my PMS is non existent, intrusive thoughts have tone down A LOT. I still fight with my lack of motivation, concentration and sleeping issues but dang, I was losing myself and now I'm able to be me again. The lamotrigine caused me a rash but I prefer that to be on the verge of colapsing, being anxious and defensive, and rude. 

I still have to get into psychotherapy, but now that I'm more stabilized I can proceed with it.
