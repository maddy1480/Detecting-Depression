I have finally reached the level of depression I thought was necessary for a diagnosis.
When I was diagnosed with MDD I figured I had it, but I was always able to still get by and manage without too much issue.

However now I find myself still in bed today at 4pm. I haven't showered in God knows how long. I haven't eaten anything. I have four essays due on Monday that I can't bring myself to write. And I want to die. Like, really this time.

This is what I pictured depression to be like and now I'm experiencing it for real. And I don't like it. I also feel like I don't have any support. No one in my life is concerned. No one cares. 

I just want to be done with this.
