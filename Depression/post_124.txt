I always tip too much
Every time I go to a restaurant I feel guilty. The fact that I’m taking up peoples time and space is automatically a problem. I’m not worth even a table, let alone the waiters time. Even if it was the worst service of my life, they’ll get about 20% just for putting up with me. 

I just feel sorry for the people in my life. My basic needs are something to apologize for. I don’t believe anyone could love me because it’s very clear that I’m a problem. I need to stop talking, I need to stop going out, I need to stop eating. I wish I could just do what I’m told and do it right, but I never can. My exhausted mind gets lazy and I forget to take out the garbage because I’m never sure what day it is. And every time I miss something it’s just more proof that I’m terrible.

I wish I could be better. I wish I could apologize and keep my promise that I’ll be perfect forever. I understand why I don’t get comfort or help. I understand what I’ve done to make it so I don’t deserve it. I’ve been a burden my whole life and I don’t know how to be a better person. I don’t know how to fix it. And I’m so tired. 

I’ve been trying to keep people from realizing. Maybe if I give up my body and time to others, they won’t realize that I’m not worth their time. Maybe if I have sex that makes me sick, then they’ll stay. I just need them to stay. But everyone seems to figure it out and realize I’m worthless. 

Maybe if I tip extra, the waiter will forgive me
