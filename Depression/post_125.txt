I’m scared my mom is going to get my depression diagnosis taken away
I’ve had a depression diagnosis for years. I’m in anti depressants and I’ve had symptoms since I was 10 years old. They’ve gotten worse as I’ve gotten older. I get episodes where I can’t eat, I won’t talk to my friends for weeks, and Ill get suicidal thoughts pretty much daily. I feel tired and like I can’t enjoy life. And no matter what I do, I don’t feel happy or even much enjoyment. I’ve taken large quantities of my medication for self harm reasons and have tried to hit blood vessels. They weren’t suicide attempts, more to see if I could if I wanted to. 

The problem my mom has is that I still go out, I’m active in the community, I run events, I still talk to my family and interact. Sometimes I eat excessively. I get out of bed. I shower most nights. 

I was reading about this psychiatrist I’m supposed to see and he said I’m an article that if your child’s grades are good and they still enjoy time with their friends then it’s unlikely that they are depressed. And I’m just terrified that that diagnosis is going to be taken away from me. 

If I’m not depressed then am I just stuck feeling this way forever? If there’s nothing wrong with me then it has to be just me. If I let my parents know I feel the way I do, my mom is going to yell at me. Tell me that I’m faking it or copy my friends.
