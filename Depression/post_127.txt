I’m getting really paranoid these days
I have medically been diagnosed with paranoia (as a symptom) and it’s getting really bad lately. 

I can feel it coming on. I feel more on edge and just generally have this sense that something is wrong. It hasn’t hit quite yet but I know it will soon. If I shower, the world feels wrong and I can’t stand it. Something bad is going to happen. And if I go to the store, I get this feeling like someone is going to hurt me. 

I saw a dog when I left the store and it looked wrong. Something was very wrong. It looked like a normal dog but it’s vibe was off. Like it wasn’t real or like it wasn’t a dog. It wasn’t right. I don’t know how but it wasn’t. 

I’m about 11 days sober and stressed out of my mind. I know stress makes it a lot worse and I’m supposed to get sober so they can know if it’s the drugs but it’s so much worse when I’m sober. This is a lot worse then it ever was when I was doing drugs even once a week. This is bad
