Nothing really matters
Long story cut short, I've suffered low mood since my late teens, medication doesn't help and neither do talking therapies. I've been told I may have undiagnosed ADHD/ASD.     
I feel very little connection to anything or anyone and to a large degree even myself, nothing matters.
I have a wife, kids, dogs, a house and a good steady job but I feel disconnected.
I'm sure I didn't always "feel" like this but as time goes by I become increasingly unsure.
