screaming into the void
I have recently stopped taking duloxetine (under medical advice), it's been an interestingly experience.
 Obviously my neurotransmitters are still out of whack as I'm very prone to tears, it's almost like empathy overload.
Anyway has anyone actually gone out into the woods/moors etc and just screamed/shouted/cried just to let it out. Does it make you feel better?
