i just want someone to talk to.
i was diagnosed with depression a little while back, and law school has triggered 3 major episodes in the past 2 years. every time i try to talk to someone about how bad i feel, my outlook is pretty negative and my language is pretty alarming. i just want to say how i feel in my head without the threat of scaring someone or compelling someone to tell me to get help. i don't want to see a doctor anymore or go on a new medication.  i just want to say how i feel. i just want to curl up in a hole and cry.
