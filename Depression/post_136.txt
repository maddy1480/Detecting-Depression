I'm a terrible person ðŸ˜£
I've got many brothers and sisters( spilt parents 3B, 3S) and as a child I was always apprently very physically abusive( I don't deny this but as a child i didnt feel anything was wrong ) to my brother as they have mentioned it to me and I feel terrible and terrified that I was even capable it's actually heartbreaking. My brother had said to me in a joking manner that its messed him up ( regardless of his tone humor tone?) I take this very seriously as I typically take most things people say very seriously.
Because I know that hes hurting mentally with alot of childhood trauma( all the siblings have had differing trama) and to know I've contributed to this as an older brother breaks me down more than I already am....

I honestly look back now and feel like I was quite and extreme child and I'm most likely ( I feel strongly that I am) autistic. As the brothers I spent the most time with have mentioned my physical transgressions( this only happend as kids pre highschool). 

I'm just shocked and if anyone else was to know they'd think they were talking about someone completely different. 

I'm just so unsure how to process this ontop of what I already cant process and what constructive things I can do to try help them heal( I've told them immediately as they told me that I'm sorry and admitted I was psycho as a child with very little restraint). 

This isnt enough for me reguradless of weather they accept this or not.... how after knowing this( after being so clueless about it ) am I supposed too...?

Lost... I'm utterly shocked and feel bizzare to have missed this???( my memory is very very good).

What do I do next( for myself and them)?


TL : DR 

I'm an abusive brother, who blames his undiagnosed autism and is clueless about others feelings....
