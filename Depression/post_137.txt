Something isnt right...
Recently I've had these weird pulsations that very weird, like my trying to faint or something but without actually fainting; I suspect this is some sort of vitamin deficiency possibly b12 as it feels like parts of my body will get hit then it's fine I have no idea how to describe this other than the fact its no normal and is happening more frequently..

I also kind of feel it in my eye balls and it feels like my vision is trying to blur or something or like rapidly shake or something and has the same sort of pulsating thing...comes and goes the more I exert myself physically( at this point almost doing anything ).

Anyone have any ideas, I'd assume its b12 or iron deficiency( seems like it isnt iron tho )

This could just be my body's response to my very high emotional state( been a bit all over the place) and have other things piling ontop..


So I'm kinda wondering what to do about this, the obvious thing to do is see a medical attention but my current financial situation is dire and really cant afford it, I've had several visits these past to months for mental health to no effect, and now I'm run dry...

I'm for sure going to end up in hospital soon I can tell but what is one to do when my problems just get left and swept under the rug cause it's not obvious enough. ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜•
