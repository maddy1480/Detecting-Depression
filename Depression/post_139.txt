Can I have social anxiety if I can talk to people in specific environments?
I went for an ADHD diagnosis. Not because I *genuinely* thought I had ADHD and needed the diagnosis, but because I’ve always known I wasn’t completely [I don’t know what word to use here, because I want to group all mental ‘disorders,’ but some of them aren’t classified as neurodivergence] and I wanted to confirm that. So I got diagnosed with mild depression and moderate to severe social anxiety instead.

I’m still processing it, because I’ve considered I might have depression and social anxiety before, but changed my mind. And that’s because when I made friends at school, I had no issue interacting with them, and also because I have no issue talking to friends on Discord.

I just feel like there’s a very small box of people in my brain that I’m able to talk to because we either share an interest I’m obsessed with, because we inhabit a space I feel super at home in, or because I’ve had ages to get used to them. It’s only people outside that narrow box who I don’t want to look at in the eyes. I’m not sure if this is a common experience for people with social anxiety or not.

I feel like I didn’t have issues making friends until it started to require conscious effort from me. I only know how to make friends by existing around them and letting them start to like me.
