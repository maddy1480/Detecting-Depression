TW: vent, My depression is on and off ever since I was diagnosed with major depression
My depression got better in the first series of quarantine (March 2020 - May 2020) Those months were the best times. Now slowly I’m giving up. I’m struggling to wake up in the morning. I sleep late because I can’t sleep. I try my best to make myself tired so I can sleep but in the end I still can’t. I have low motivation and mostly I don’t want to heal and be better anymore. I got used to being like this now I don’t know what’s going to happen to me. I took a break in school. I’m supposed to graduate this year but I’m not so here I am. I don’t care if I graduate late but I just want to remove this depressed mind but I’m extremely tired of trying and trying yet it is still not enough. I don’t know what to do now. I just want to sleep but I can’t sleep. My appetite changes a lot too. I don’t have the energy to get ready and go to therapy. I can’t even take care of myself.
