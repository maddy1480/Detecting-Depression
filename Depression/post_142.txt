I'm lonely and don't know what to do about it
Life is complicated . I was in a year of service program (similar to Americorp, but faith based), and was in an intentional community with 7 others, 8 including me. I say was bc the program was cut 7 months early bc of covid...

Anyway, Some made friends fast, others, mainly me, took time to build trust and rapport. Having the program end 7 months early has killed the friendships that were growing. 3 people have left, they were the foundation of the group. I have my 2 housemates, and 2 other girls (A and B) living together. A is pretty much best of friends with my 2 housemates, and she lives with B. Which leaves me the odd woman out. 

As much as I want to be friends with them, I don't necessarily like them too much. They're great people, but I just dont click or vibe with them. Which was fine until the 3 foundational people left. I sit alone in the family room everyday, expect during work (which mu last day is tomorrow), hoping I would be able to join conversations. But those only end up happening in my housemates' bedrooms. No one is ever in the common space. Everyone is always in their own bedroom. I don't understand why perfectly sociable people hermit themselves away, when those with mental health (me) try to stay in common spaces in order to be socialable and approachable. 

I have no friends, I'm leaving a job I didn't really like bc I didn't have friends there either, I'm hopefully starting a new job Monday, where I will get more interaction with others. I'm lonely with people around me. I need more people in my life, I need friends in my life.
