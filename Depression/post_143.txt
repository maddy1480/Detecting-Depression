Regret
I just need to rant somewhere. In May 2017 I got a breast reduction, bc of back pain. I had never been in a true relationship, had never had sex, and had super sensitive nipples. In Oct 2019 I found out I'm more bipolar than depressed, bc I had a manic episode that consisted of having sex with 7 guys in 6 days. In May-Jul 2020 I had another small episode, and had sex with a few too many guys. One of those guys wasn't clean, and now I have herpes. Diagnosed in July 2020. 

I am now finally in a real relationship. We want to fool around and wait to have sex for while. I told him I have herpes, he's okay with it, but now he won't touch me down there. He understands herpes and isn't grossed out and doesn't think any less of me. But now that I want him to touch me, he's hesitant. Plus, bc of my reduction I can't feel my nipples anymore, like at all. And bc he's hesitant to go down under, he focuses on my boobs, but that doesn't do anything for me. 

I regret a lot right now. I regret my breast reduction big time, I could cum with only my nipples, but now I get nothing from them. I regret having sex with so many guys, bc I could have avoided herpes all together. I've never regretted so much of my life before. Sure I've wished for it to end, but this is the first time I'm truly regretting parts of my life. And I can't do a damn thing about it.

*big sigh* ðŸ˜” I feel like I'm dying on the inside whenever I'm with my guy, and it sucks.
