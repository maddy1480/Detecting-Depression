All These Diagnoses and Now Nothing
TL;DR I was pulled off my meds, diagnosed with a TON of new mental illnesses and not given new meds. 

I started to overhaul all my meds and meet with a new team. I met with two members, took an assessment test and I was supposed to meet with a Nurse Practitioner so she could start me on a new medical regimen. 

Prior, I was diagnosed with Major Depression, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Borderline Tendencies and Insomnia. 

New Diagnosis: Double Depression (look it up, basically means I never feel okay), PTSD (childhood trauma), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, an “Unspecified Mood Disorder” and PMDD plus Insomnia. So I’m a mess. I’m also a mom who will be homeschooling my 7 year old so I have to get my sh*t together. Quick. 

Unfortunately I was not able to meet with the Nurse Practitioner the Quaratine was mandated and she’s the one who writes the Rx. So I’m doing this all unmedicated and I’m starting to crack. 

I’m calling tomorrow to tell them they gave me all these crazy new diagnoses and they need to manage me medically somehow. They’re only doing meetings over the phone, however the drugs I need can’t be “called in.” They need to figure something out, though, because I’m starting to lose myself with all the craziness going on.
