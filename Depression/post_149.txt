Just been diagnosed with depression
Hi, everyone, last Thursday i went to a psychiatrist after a long period of struggle and he diagnosed me with depression. I got prescribed fluoxetine and i just started 3 days ago. 

My whole ordeal started with health anxiety and after a ton of tests I decided to see a psychiatrist who said that, if everything else is ruled out we have to consider depression.

I have to be onest, i am very afraid of the possibility of a misdiagnosis. I feel so weak and tired every day. I used to run almost every day and now i can bearly do it at all. I feel light headed 24/7. I feel like I'm wasting away day by day. Can depression really do that? I am afraid my doctors missed something...
(I did a complete blood test, multiple geart ultrasounds, ecgs, xrays, spirographs... All clear)

I don't know what i have or who to urn to...
