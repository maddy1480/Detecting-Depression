Personality changes since being diagnosed
Last year I was diagnosed with clinical depression. That's when I started noticing changes in my personality. From being painfully introverted, to being extroverted. I used to fear going up to strangers and now it's like second nature to me. I also talk a mile a minute now and people around me started calling me a rapper because of this lmao. Can depression or meds cause this? I've been on 20mg of escitalopram for a year as well.
