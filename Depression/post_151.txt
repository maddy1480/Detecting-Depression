I was diagnosed by my clinical psychiatrist friend
About a month ago, my friend (who’s a clinical psychiatrist) and I were just randomly talking about how far we’ve come since high school.

Challenges we faced and overcome. She mentioned the time were I was severely depressed during college days, I would cut or overdosed myself, drink until I passed out on the street. It was hell of a phased. 

During that time, I tried to get help. It didn’t worked for me. It was actually blank. I couldn’t even remember a thing during my session’s with my psychiatrist. All I know is that I was diagnosed with severe anxiety and mild depression.

She told me that, sometimes, our brain can block a memory when it register an overwhelming trauma. Those sessions could’ve have been traumatic for me. 

But after those session’s, I told her, I was in a state of euphoria, I became numb, I couldn’t feel sad, heck I don’t even know what “sad” feels like. All I know what to feel is “happy”, every time something happens that I know for myself that would break me, I’ll just shrugged it off and smiles.

That’s when she diagnosed me with clinical depression. Having feeling nothing, like seriously nothing, where life is completely meaningless. Can’t show any feelings other than a fake smile everyday. Also, how self aware of me with my mental illness. It would be hard to treat since I’m already in the last stage of depression. But I could still get therapy if I wanted to.

Thanks for reading.
