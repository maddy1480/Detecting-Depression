i am diagnosed and i want to stop taking my meds because i feel so numb
hi guys, it’s really not my thing posting in social medias but i had the sudden urge to share because i’ve got no one rn. as you can see in the post, im diagnosed (mdd, anxiety disorder, bpd, adhd), and ive been taking up escitalopram for quite a few months now and to be honest, it helped me a lot. however, i started to relapse again, and a lot of problems are coming to me right now, and i can’t feel anything. i badly want to cry, i badly want to write and sort out my thoughts but no, i can’t really feel anything. i forcefully tried making me cry, and while it happened, it just ended up being fake tears. crying has helped me before calm myself down; but ever since i started to take my meds, id only get panic attacks if something disturbing happened to me. like something is putting a barrier inside my chest so i wont feel or think anything. tbh, i dont know what i expect to receive posting this, i just really need to vent this out bc im not really good at words or expressing problems like these. hope you all had a wonderful day.
