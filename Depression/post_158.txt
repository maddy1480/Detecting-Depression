Having depression doesn't give you the right to diagnose other people and tell them whether or not they have depression or is just "romanticizing" it.
I used to be guilty of this and never fully realized how much of an asshole I was back then until I heard one of my acquaintances committed suicide by hanging herself from the ceiling in her bedroom. We were not that close but she initially came off to me as one of those "SJW tumblr girls" that see mental illness as some sort of fad. She would often rant on facebook about being depressed and I immediately assumed that she does it for attention. I have never felt so disgusted by myself after hearing the news. I was diagnosed with clinical depression six years ago and used that to justify talking shit about other people when I've never lived their life in the first place. 

She died a year ago and I've stopped trying to be so judgmental since then.
