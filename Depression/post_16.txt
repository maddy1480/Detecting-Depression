I got diagnosed with depression today
I was suicidal and depressed for a really long time but my parents refused to get me a therapist, I got one once but I only attended one session before my mom told me to cancel it because “she didn’t notice any difference”


Well. I found out my university offers therapy and counselling, and well, I did have depression.

She described it as severe, I’ve been crying and having suicidal thoughts daily, I spent hours each day in my bed crying wishing I’d never wake up, and I can’t draw and play video games like I used to, when I try to draw something my brain always wanders to dark places, I have no idea why.


I can’t believe it took this long to get me help, I’m really disappointed at my parents.


I’ll start medication pretty soon, my therapist told me they had to run some tests on me first before they can give me antidepressants, I really hope it works on me


It’s been really hard, I’m sorry for the rant.

And I’m sorry if this post is a mess, my brain is all over the place
