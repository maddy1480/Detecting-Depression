Diagnosed with Severe Major depression but I dont feel depressed?
Im just looking for some insight and perhaps anyone else who was diagnosed but doesnt nessecarily feel depressed. Im not trying to undermine anyone elseâ€™s depression either. I just dont feel hopeless and the whole shabang. I was also diagnosed with ADHD. The only depressive symptoms I have are negative self talk ( daily ) and recluse behavior ( because of my weight gain ) but Im still a happy person, I can still enjoy things, I still have fun, I have maybe just maybe one depressive episode per week where I cry about family life or my figure. But thats about it if im being honest and my episodes last maybe an hour or two. I dont have a deep pit of sadness or anything no suicidal thoughts I just get triggered with certain things. If anyone can shed some light that would be great. I trust my psychiatrist just kind of confused.
