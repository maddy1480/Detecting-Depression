I just got diagnosed and it feels surreal...
I've (21 F) always felt depressed and I kinda always thought I was but it feels so surreal when I was legitimately diagnosed. I only realized this year that constantly wanting to die, fantasizing about my suicide, and laying in bed just staring at the ceiling at 8 am when I have a class at 8 am isn't normal.... I've lived my life dragging my feet for pretty much my whole life that this is what's normal to me. To be honest, I feel like a weak ass bitch. I feel like I have no right to feel this way because my parents provided me with everything (albeit they weren't very good parents). Does your diagnosis feel surreal as well?
