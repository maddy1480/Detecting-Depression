It's getting to the point where I have no motivation to take care of myself and other thoughts
My eating has always been off, but it's gotten worse. I only eat like at the most 3/4 of a full meal a day, with maybe a little snack.  
My family thinks my eating is doing alright, but they don't know how little I eat, they think I eat at College. I have lost some weight, but they have noticed my jeans are getting baggy.
I don't want to shower or get dressed or wash or brush my teeth.  
My sleeping isn't that good, but that could also be part of my PTSD. I also have BPD but I thought this was more suitable here. I can't concentrate enough in College.  
I don't socialize that much, but I do have people that let me when I want to.   
I'm thinking of suicide every day, it can vary in how intense it is.  
Luckily I know how to act so no-one gets worried.  
I don't actually get depressed that often, I more get frustrated or upset, but there are times where I cant reconigze or know what I'm feeling, or if I feel at all. Times where I feel numb, or nothing feels weird.
I'm meant to get my ID sorted so I can start drinking, so it can help. But I can't even get that sorted.  
I'm not normal, I don't do anything right, I don't really have any actual friends. People would do so much better without me.  
I have no purpose, and it would be better if I wasn't here, but I'm too fearful to go through with it just yet. Hopefully soon.  
I can't take this again, I hate myself so much.
