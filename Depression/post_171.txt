my parents refuse to believe I am depressed even though I have been diagnosed
My mum had the audacity to tell me that I am not depressed. I go to a therapist once every week. I have been diagnosed by a doctor. I deal with suicidal thoughts everyday, and they know this. They were supposed to be there for me. They said that I can always come to them but they never listen to me when I tell them that I am not coping. My dad keeps telling me that I have to fix myself. My therapist recommends that I try antidepressants but my dad won't let me.

I just feel let down by the people who are supposed to take care of me.

I just don't really know what to do
