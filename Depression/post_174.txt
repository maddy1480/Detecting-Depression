Fake friends
Honestly, the friends I have right now just don’t feel genuine. They’re just friends with me because my grandma works at the school I go to. Sure, they’re nice, but it feels like they’re nice to me because they feel like they have to be or they just pity me. I had a “friend” that showed his real side to me a day ago. He hides my stuff from me as a "joke" and makes me feel bad about myself, so I should have known he was fake from the start. Since then, it’s been hard to trust any of my “friends”.
