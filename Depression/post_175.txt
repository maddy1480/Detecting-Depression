acceptance
at this point, i don't care about changing anymore. lets be real though. was i ever going to try any way? nah. whenever a problem occurs in my life, i either handle the situation like a pussy or i just avoid the situation all together. and plus, changing requires motivation and hope to do so, but i hardly have any of those two. be honest, do you really think a person with this mind set can change?
