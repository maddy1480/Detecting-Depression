Bad days
I don’t want to get bullied anymore. When I do get bullied, I never defend myself because I don’t know how. I was supposed to be in school about a week ago but I’m just skipping and isolating myself so no one hurts me. Today my family made me get a fucked up hair cut and it’s definitely not going to help the bullying at all. Fuck my barber and fuck school.
