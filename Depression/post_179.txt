Newly diagnosed with depression
Hello, I’m 25(f) and I was diagnosed with depression a few months ago. It was starting to affect my physical health. Finally the doctors saw my depression, listened to me, and medicated me for it. It’s been one of the best things for my physical and mental health and I’ve felt great the last few weeks. But my family is going through a really hard time right now and I feel myself slipping back a little. I know medicine only helps so much and it’s common to still feel depressed even when on medicine. I was wondering after you were medicated and had spurts of depression, how long did it last? Or how long did it take for you to feel the good effects from the medicine again?
