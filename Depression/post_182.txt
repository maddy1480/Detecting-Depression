Is it long haul COVID or Residual depression ?
Hello everyone,

In november 2020 I started having anxiety, irritability, GI issues, insomnia, brain fog, loss of hair, lack of motivation, dizziness, depersonalisation, Memory loss, chronic fatigue, IBS syndrome, tremors, heart racing, tinnitus, dry mouth, light/noise sensitivity, tachycardia, erectile dysfunction. 

At that time my GI diagnosed me with a "burnout"/anxiety/depression.

18 months and 6 antidepressants trial later, I still have chronic fatigue, vertigo, brain fog, memory loss and GI issues. I am not dismissing the anxiety/depression since I really felt depressed for months after losing my job and my girlfriend because of chronic fatigue and erectile dysfunction. 

My main concern is that now I don't feel depressed or anxious anymore since at least 9 months but I am still tired as fuck, didn't recovered my cognition and feel dizzy a lot of the time. Is it normal for depressed people to keep this fatigue after "remission" to the point they are still not functional ? If yes does it go away ?

I am starting to think my depression was caused by a long haul COVID since I have a confirmed infection and I never had anxiety problems before and this symptoms appeared extremely quickly. From one week to another. Is it possible ? Anyone in the same situation ? Is there a way to tell the difference between long haul and depression ? Is there a solution ? 

I am motivated to do things etc, I juste don't have the energy. I tried Escitalopram 20mg, Effexor 150mg, vortioxetine 10mg, Fluoxetine 40mg, Fluoxetine 20mg + buproprion 150mg. 

Please give me some advice. :)
