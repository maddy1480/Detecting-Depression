Just diagnosed with moderate depression. Need suggestions on how to cope with this.
Hi guys, so today I was diagnosed by psychiatrist that I have moderate depression due to turbulence emotions, mood swings and cannot functions on my work. The doctor prescribed me meds but I feel like I still can function on other areas such as social life and do things that I enjoy. I kinda hesitant to take the meds just because Iâ€™m afraid of the side effects, also it would be addictive and can cause worse relapse once I off meds. Do you guys have any experience on how to overcome the depression? What did you do? Any naturally ways to boost up the serotonin levels?

Thanks :)
