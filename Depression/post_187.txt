Is there anyone who's been diagnosed with depression, But doesn't have sadness, or suicidal thoughts?
Hello, I have been diagnosed with ADHD although neither mean or my psychiatrist or 100% confident on that. We're trying medication to see if we can manage the symptoms and so far I've tried a few to no avail. It's no secret that ADHD and depression share a lot of symptoms, while there's few that they don't share. For example I have no problem falling asleep, even when taking simulants, Which is more commonly associated with depression. However I've never felt feelings of hopelessness, I don't feel generally sad, and I've never had suicidal thoughts. The biggest symptoms I have are executive dysfunction, and a noticeable lack of energy to go along with it. However the lack of motivation does not apply to stimulating activities.

I started taking Adderall about two and a half ago, And while it's not doing anything at all to help with my in attention problems or other symptoms of ADHD, It works absolute magic in terms of being an antidepressant. It's like putting on glasses for the first time. I didn't realize how angry and frustrated and negative and unoptimistic I really was. But The Adderall has completely changed that, I am incredibly optimistic and positive now, And the extra positivity alone has not solved my executive dysfunction problems, but made them much more manageable.

The question in the title is really what I'm curious about, If anyone has depression without feeling sad, or any of The general feelings associated with depression. It's no secret that both of the conditions are commonly co-present in an individual, especially since I'm pretty sure I've had ADHD since I was a small child, now 27.

Any other advice or questions/comments on anything else I mentioned is also appreciated ☺️
