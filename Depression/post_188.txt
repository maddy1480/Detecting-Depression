I have been diagnosed with severe depression, I did not have a clue I was depressed
Hello!

I came to this sub to try to better understand my condition.

I am a 33 years old man, who lost everything (business, savings, dignity) thanks to the COVID restrictions.

In the past 2 years I've been slowly rebuilding my business, doing several burnouts due to financial pressure of raising a family, the families that lost their jobs because of the closing of the business and the guilt of not being able to do much about it. The decisions of the government completely wrecked me.

After I finally managed to reopen, I decided to visit a psychiatrist, who diagnosed me with severe depression and got me hooked with a pill called Pristiq. I arrived at her office a complete mess, and tears and hard breathing.

After a week of bad secondary effects and mixed feelings, my brain finally slowed down to a point where a I feel apathy for everything and everyone, but I'm least I'm leveled enough to be able to understand what just happened and I'm starting to analyze the whole situation.

I will also start psycho-therapy, and I'm not sure what that means.

I am wondering if there is anyone with a similar experience and any tips on how to cope with the situation would be greatly appreciated.

It is my first time dealing with a mental illness and I am scared. I am completely functional and pushing forward and my main objective is to get off that pill so I can enjoy my full range of emotions again.

Looking forward to reading from you =)
