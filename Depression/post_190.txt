Severe Depression in medschool sucks
My self-esteem is low. I lack behind of everyone i started with (I need at least 1 year more study time). My fear of failure is so huge I delayed an exam 6 times now. I hope I can start Therapy this year cause every Psychologist is full and I dont have the energy to tell every Psychologist my situation. 1 time is stressful enough. Then who am I tell that I have depression in medschool. My parents support me but I can see in their eyes that they worry about me very much which makes me even more anxious. My schleep schedule is shit and I am close being heavily underweight. With 23 years I never even got remotely close to a girl. Then I see how my friends have a good life with a partner and I am happy for them. But of course you compare yourself to your friends and realize you are a disaster at the moment. 

I dont want to be a burden but man it fucking sucks with this disease. I am determined to get out of this hole of nothing but seeing the mountain needed to climb sometimes makes me loose my determination.
