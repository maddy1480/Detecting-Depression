I am experiencing repressed anger
I have repressed anger. I am quiet and good-presenting to family and friends, but I uncontrollably pushed hard a door today and I'm playing very violent videogames trying to convey my anger to fictional characters (I've rarely played videogames). I don't know what to do. Exercise the body does not help. I don't know what to do, I'm scared.
