What have I become (Diagnosed with depression, addicted to porn, visited a prostitute, and yet desperate to turn my life around, despite feeling empty all the time)
Hi all. I am new here. I posted a similar story to noFap since itâ€™s related to porn as well, but mostly, it is also about my depression and anxiety.

Two years back, I lost my dad, and ever since then, I wasn't my usual, confident self. I had to see a psychiatrist as I was really stressed with life (at that time, my job was causing me anxiety as well), and had anhedonia, basically couldn't enjoy anything despite having the money to spend. Now I have a good job, a good family, and everything else, but I feel empty. I couldn't enjoy any of my usual activity (whether gaming, watching movies, meeting friends, etc) except for one thing. Pornography.  
My psychiatrist told me that I was diagnosed with depression, and gave me medications. It did help for a bit, but I realised my problem was more than that. 

I watch porn to distract my mind from the emptiness. Soon enough, even porn doesn't entice me. As even pornography didn't 'fulfil' me, I decided to visit a prostitute. The experience was really different from watching porn, and I am not really sure whether I enjoyed it. Perhaps I was really nervous, as that was the first time I had sex. Anyway, I don't want to do that too, as that isn't real love (and also to avoid getting infections).

I realised things got a little too far, and I told myself enough is enough. I want to stop this. But sometimes the self-loathing gets a little too far, and I would think of ending it once and for all. I still don't know what I can do to fill the emptiness (tried keeping a journal but couldn't keep the habit). Decided to post here to tell myself that I am taking things seriously, and hopefully, I can learn many things from you guys. Thank you all.
