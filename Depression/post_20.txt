do people with MDD/major depression ever have days where they don't feel depressed/down or that their mood is stable?
During let's say a single week, do people diagnosed with MDD ever have a stable mood/non depressed mood, where they don't feel happy obviously, but don't particularly have a down/depressed mood?
Like simply a stable or ordinary mood, I'm not saying happy, or manic or anything, but just an ordinary/stable/non depressed mood?
Do they have days like that during a given single week?
And if they do, how many days of a week? 3 days? 2? 1?
Or is their mood depressed or sad all the time or almost all the time?
Does it rule out to be diagnosed with MDD, if you have stable/non depressed mood, for about 3 or 2 days of a single week?
Or do people with MDD are almost all the time severely depressed or just depressed?
Can you be diagnosed with MDD even if you have stable mood days for like 2 or 3 times a week?

PS - if you are not a psychiatrist/psychologist, and you are diagnosed with MDD, please let me know the status of your mood in about a week time.
How many days of the week do you feel depressed? And how many of those days are severe depressed mood?
