I've been diagnosed with clinical depression, and I can't handle it.
I'm sick of this feeling I just want to feel ok, I'm always so down and everyone is saying "oh smile more!" well I can't, I can't be happy I mean fuck I try I really do but everything feels pointless therapy didn't help, the pills I get don't help, honestly drinking feels like the only solution but I don't want to go down the path what do I do? how can get out of this slope? I don't think I can take it for much longer.
