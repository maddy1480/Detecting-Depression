Does anyone have experience with Tofranil (Imipramine)? I just started on it and am wondering what to expect. Thanks!
Some people love it and others hate it. It's too early to tell yet for me. 

I Just started 4 days ago to treat anxiety and depression. The doc said it might help me sleep, but so far I'm finding that it keeps me up! (My instructions are to take my dosage after dinner, which tends to be close to my bedtime.) Otherwise, I've got the expected dry mouth already. No other real complaints. 

I'd be grateful to anyone who is willing to share their experiences. Thanks!
