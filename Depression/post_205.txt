Any time I wake up in the middle of the night, my first thought is, “You’re going to die someday.” Anyone else experience that?
Just turned 40, family man, been doing a lot of reflecting on my current career (teacher) and whether or not I should stay, how staying/leaving could impact the aforementioned family, and how best to proceed from here.


With that said, I’ve been doing a lot of tossing and turning in the last 12-18 months. More often than not, when I wake up in the middle of the night, the first thing that comes to mind is that I’m going to die someday, possibly sooner than I think. Not sure how best to process that (I’m thinking it has to do with the uncertainty in my life right now), but I’d love to get to a place where I wake up at 2 or 3 am and say, “Wow. It’s so early. Back to bed.” I’d much rather that than waking up at those times and immediately thinking about my eventual death.
