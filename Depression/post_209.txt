Don’t know how I’m still alive
Had a very foolish attempt
Had the worst break up ever
Had the worst fight of my life with my brother 
Didn’t speak to my family for 2 months
My doctor didn’t pick up my calls to prescribe me medicine 
My therapist just suddenly disappeared a few months before covid 
My brother’s gf randomly stopped talking to me after my fight with my brother(really thought i was her friend and not just her boyfriend’s brother)
Met the most positive person who was going through so much
Lost her in march of 2021 but didn’t get to know until april of 2021 because our mutual thought it was best for my mental health to not know at that time
Am barely getting through academic though I’ve been a state topper before
Barely like going out
Haven’t cried or spoke about my feelings in a year 
Stopped voicing out my opinion 
Being there for my friend at any point of the day even though i am struggling and have finals in 2 weeks 
Trying to be there for random strangers on reddit because they deserve all the happiness and support 
Have been told ‘it’s not okay to take so much time to be okay’ ‘it’s the same thing again and again’ 
I’ve lost my friendship with so many
