I don't know what to do.
I've been working at my retail job for almost 3 years(3years in June), and I just can't do it anymore. I can't stand being around customers because they're rude for no reason, and coworkers tend to underestimate me.

I call in from work a lot because I just get anxious thinking about how my day is gonna go, even though it's probably not gonna be bad. Some customers expect me to know everything about every single item, and get upset when I don't know. And then I end up doing things that I'm not supposed to, like activating phones, because I don't want them to get upset with me. 

Then on top of that, I see my ex who broke up with me because “I didn't put any effort into the relationship” with another guy and it makes me jealous. And switching to another department of the store won't help because she has to go everywhere in the store(stocking, pulling pallets), and I feel like I'm too stupid to do anything else in the store anyways.

I want to look for another job, but as I said, I feel like I'm too stupid to do anything else because I get overwhelmed easily. I know customers are always like this, and switching to another job won't change anything. My doctor told me I should avoid remote jobs because isolating myself will make my depression worse(even though I isolate myself all the time). 

I don't know what to do with myself. I'm struggling to learn how to code so I can have that as a skill, I don't feel like returning to online school because I feel like I'm too stupid for it, and I'm scared to get another job because I'm not good at anything in general, I just don't know. 

And for those of you reading this, please don't tell me to just man up, you should've known what you were getting into, move on from your ex, just suck it up, grow some balls, and be a man, or stop being a pussy. I've heard all of those things, and I've had it with being told that.
