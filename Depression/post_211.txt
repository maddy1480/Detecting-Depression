Therapy
I’m a 21 year old diagnosed with major depressive disorder. I had a doctor before lockdown and when lockdown started, he didn’t pick up my calls and well I couldn’t get the prescription for my medication. I also had a therapist who just left her job without saying anything and she left with my test results which the doctor had asked for to help him assess my condition. He thought i might have bipolarity and anger issues and other stuff. 
A few people keep telling me to try therapy again. Here is the thing. Obviously there is the past experience and also, I can’t ask my parents for money because I don’t want to worry them more than i already have . And i am still a student with minimal savings . I don’t know what to do
