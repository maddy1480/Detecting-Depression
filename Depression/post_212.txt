Diagnosed with depression for the first time.
Hello all,
I am new here as I was just diagnosed with depression for the first time. I have had an anxiety disorder for early 10 years but noticed lots of new symptoms on the past month. I feel unmotivated, I can’t concentrate or remember anything. I’ve meant to pack my lunch every day this week and I forgot every day. I feel like I’m not serving any purpose or important to anyone. I feel like if I weren’t here no one would be upset except my husband. I’m not actively suicidal or anything but I reached out to an agency for help. They diagnosed me with moderate depression. 

I feel like I’m an imposter, though, like maybe I accidentally misled them about how severe it is? I know that I’m having problems that seem like depression but I get up every morning and take care of all the things I need to. I go to work and even though I don’t do great, I do enough that they tell me I work hard. I know this is having a negative effect on my life but I’m still functioning. 

On the flip side, some days I feel like I’m genuinely in crisis and I need help like right that second. Nothing bad has happened but these insane swings between “am I faking it?” And “fuck if I died right now it wouldn’t be so bad” are confusing me. 

I’d love any support or advice you have to offer.
