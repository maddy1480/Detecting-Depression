I want to ask for work accommodations but I’m scared.
I’ve been dealing with moderate-severe depression for 11 months now, medicated for 10. Overall my moods have been better with the occasional deep downward swing, but one symptom that won’t go away is my constant fatigue. I go to sleep at or before 10 PM every night and wake up at 6:30 AM every morning, but there are several days a week that I can’t keep my eyes open. I’ve even resorted to setting a 15 minute timer and laying my head down on my desk sometimes because I just can’t stay awake. 

I’m at a point where I feel the need to ask for an accommodation to come in an hour or two later and leave later. My boss however has a very traditional attitude about workplace. He thinks we should all arrive early, work late, never take time off, etc. He often complains about how “soft” my generation is (he is considerably older) and that “mental health days shouldn’t exist.” 

I know I would be technically protected from discrimination if I went to my institution’s HR, but I’m on a term contract and I’m afraid he will use this as a reason not to renew my contract or that he will give me negative remarks on my evaluation when the time comes because he thinks of my mental illness as laziness and not a true illness. 

Has anyone else requested accommodations like this? How did it go? Any advice is appreciated.
