My psychiatrist denied my request for accommodations.
I got my request for accommodations approved by my job pending a letter from my psychiatrist. I’ve been waiting over a week for her to get back to me about it. Today, her nurse called and said she “doesn’t feel comfortable” writing an ADA accommodation letter for me. 
I’m kinda devastated. I feel like the only way I can be successful here is to have help. I can’t stay awake, I’m not alert enough to drive, and it’s just getting worse the darker it gets outside. I feel like I’m about to hit a downward spiral and there’s no way I can stop it. 

All I asked for was to come in an hour late 2 days a week and my employer was fine with it. I feel betrayed. I feel like it’s now going to be a battle to get what I need from her. I feel hopeless.
