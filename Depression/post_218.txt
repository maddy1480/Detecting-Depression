I dream of doing the worst things to myself
I used to have dreams that predicted future events. Not usually significant events, but events like being in a certain room and getting a sense of deja Vu years later when I was in that exact room looking at the exact object in my dream. These were the only dreams I remembered more than 5 minutes after waking.

Now I have no such dreams, haven't for several years. Now my dreams are of me damaging my body, causing physical and emotional pain to myself, my friends and family taking turns beating and mutilating me. I dreamed recently about finding the perfect partner, having her bright blue eyes stare into mine and truly feel affection. Not much time after, she and my closest friend were sawing my legs off and laughing. And I was ok with it. If that made them happy, that's all that mattered. Even awake, if my friends would benefit from my suffering, I hesitate to say that would be a bad thing.

Maybe I'm too far gone and suicide is the only option. Maybe I allow myself to allow everyone to take their anger and frustration out on me. If it would make them happy to torture and mutilate my body then I'm okay with it. They deserve so much better, and I never deserved to be born. If I could prevent my birth, I would take it in a heart beat. We can't turn back time, we can only end. We have a beginning and an end, and only we ourselves can decide an end that is suitable. For being useless, for not giving enough to everyone, for living on auto pilot, I decide to give my life to anyone who wishes to take it.
