The universe is unfair and you cannot blame others for it
I have been diagnosed MDD for over a decade. I'm sure if I was 100% honest I'd have more labels to tack on. I think many wish they could scapegoat their problems onto others or their own inadequacies.
I have friends, good friends at that.
I have relationships, some may not have lasted but they have all been good more than bad.
I have family that isn't bad,ost are callous to others problems, but it doesn't mean they're bad, just selfish. Selfishness leads to evil, but in low concentration it can be tolerable.
I have food and shelter, which unfortunately cannot be said for a large portion of people in the world.
So why is it I'm unable to feel happy? Why is it the only time I feel someone relieved is when people are happy? Imagine it's like a big plate in the middle of the table with the most succulent food on it. And everyone around you is tearing into it, enjoying themselves, laughing, and living. And you're there staring at it with zero appetite?
What has to break in the mind for us to no longer process that hunger? I don't blame anyone for my minds own failings. I don't want revenge on anyone who may have wronged me. Even the people I deemed 'evil' in my youth I pray for forgiveness and happiness. I would not want anyone to suffer through that mindset every day of their life. The universe is not fair and never claimed it to be. Fairness is a human concept. The best broken people can hope is to give hope to those who haven't lost it yet.
