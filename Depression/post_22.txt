Why do I feel like I have nothing to be depressed about and I’m just faking it for attention and sympathy?
I’ve been thinking to myself that I’m really just being lazy and I’m just using depression and anxiety as an excuse for my laziness. That I use the bad times that have happened in my life as excuses for my behavior. There are times where I call in sick to work because I feel sick to my stomach, but right after calling in, I feel fine, which makes me believe that I’m being a fraud.

I want to tell my therapist when I go that I feel like I’m faking all of my mental health issues, but then I worry that they’ll think I am just being a fake. I’ve told people at work that I’m dealing with depression, and that I’m going through issues, but what if all of the issues are just in my little brain. Like the day I called in sick to work, I told my coworker that I’m close with and who has been through some things as well that I was feeling too anxious to go to work, and she just told me, “Grow the fuck up, grow some balls and be a man. How are you going to live life if you’re always depressed and shit.” 

I feel like I can do the simplest things, like clean my room, do my laundry, do school work, go to work, and get out of bed, but I just choose not to, and feel like a fraud for labeling it as anxiety and depression. Another coworker told me that I overdramatize everything, that it’s not really anxiety that I have, it’s just overthinking. And another coworker told me that others have it worse than I, and they still show up to work and do what they have to do.

I don’t know what to think of myself anymore. Maybe I don’t really need therapy, maybe I just need to try harder, maybe I just to get my lazy ass out of bed, and maybe I should just grow up and be a man.

P.S. Sorry if I’m posting on here a lot of what has already been explained to me. I just feel so alone knowing that mostly everyone I know personally thinks that I’m just being lazy and not trying to improve.
