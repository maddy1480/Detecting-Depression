can somebody help me out with this?
I'm in a psyche ward due to a suicide attempt (cut my neck bad, drenched in blood and almost bled out), and I asked if I could try olanzapine because for some reason they gave it to me for two nights in my last admission, and I felt good on it. They told me no, it's an antipsychotic and I'm not psychotic... But I've been prescribed Seroquel for the last year, which a quick google search says its an anti psychotic. I don't get it.

It was at the start of the year and i still remember how it made me feel. I felt like my old self, but no matter how hard I push for it they just refuse to do it.
