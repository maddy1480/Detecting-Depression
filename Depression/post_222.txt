How do you guys deal with things you're not proud of doing?
At times I've gotten a bit psychotic. Said plenty of things to people that are close to me. Done stupid crap. I'm left with tremendous anxiety thinking about it all and then the cycle repeats, pick up a bottle to numb the thoughts and memories.... Like how do you deal with making an absolute ass of yourself...
