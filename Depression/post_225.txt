I think my MDD diagnosis is broken
So I was diagnosed with MDD, have had it since i was 12 and i’m 17. Too long for a kid so it’s a reasonable diagnosis. However I’m pretty sure i’m not supposed to have random bouts of paranoia. I’m not saying like there’s aliens but in a “i think someone’s watching me/ maybe my phone is tapped/ check for cameras and then go about my day/ i heard something not there once” kinda thing. Depression is my natural state, then something like this happens for a bit or i just get happy/hyper which makes me think i’m faking depression, and then i’m just straight severely depressed. I have no idea what’s up and i slightly don’t wanna tell my therapist bc she’s been hinting at the psych ward, the one in my city for kids isn’t hot (as i’m sure other psych wards aren’t either) and it’s senior year🤩🤙🏾 Advice? I’m not gonna say i’m crazy but i’m not... fully alright lmao
