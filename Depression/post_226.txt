I was diagnosed with clinical depression when I was 13. Today I found my sketchbook from 2010-11, the year leading up to my diagnosis.

So in 2011 I was diagnosed with clinical depression. Today, while I was cleaning up, I found the sketchbook I used during the year leading up to the diagnosis, and thought it was interesting to see how the drawings changed as the depression got worse. 

Hope you find it interesting too :)
