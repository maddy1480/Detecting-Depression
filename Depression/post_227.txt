The night before , I was having dangerous thoughts so I decided to calm myself with some Ativan in the end i ended up taking 9mgs. The morning i went to school, people, my assistant principal, teachers ex. realized. I left and today I don’t know what to tell them. I don’t know how to explain what happened and why happened.
