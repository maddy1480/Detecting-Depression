I don’t have motivation for college anymore.
I’m currently in my 3rd term in college. The first two terms went well, but my current term has been otherwise. I’ve only finished 1 course out of the 4 assigned in 5 months. 

This semester has been difficult for me to stay focused because I had to deal with my dad. My dad had his leg amputated, so I had to take care of him, and go to work. 11 months after the amputation, my dad passed away. For the first month after his death, I would constantly blame myself for what he did. I couldn’t focus on school or anything, I just wanted to lay in bed all day. 

Now, I sometimes feel okay, but other times I just feel lazy. I keep thinking that I’m wasting my time with college, and I have no urge to be productive.
