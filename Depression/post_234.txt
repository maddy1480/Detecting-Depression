anyone else anxious about being underdressed (rather than overdressed)?
I feel like most with SA are anxious about wearing nice clothes or different clothes bc it might attract attention, but for me wearing casual clothes makes me more anxious. Even when I was doing online school and basically nobody saw me except my family and my dog, I wore jeans practically every day, which was pretty uncomfortable ngl bc tight or stiff pants just bother me. Like I have worn sweats outside the house maybe once in the past 10 years bc I don't want people to judge me for wearing something different than my usual or thinking Im a slob lol. Even if wearing nice clothes is not appropriate for the situation (like painting or smth) I'm too anxious to wear not-nice clothing. Except another part of me is worried about looking like a try-hard for wearing nice clothes all the time when everyone else around me is dressed casually. 

Just in general I've always been anxious about clothes. As a kid I would only wear leggings bc everything else would make me anxious. No jeans, no shorts; doesn't matter the weather. Also wearing shoes with laces would make me anxious bc I was so used to wearing velcro (thankfully I have gotten over that lol) I think k the common theme here is wearing something out of the norm for me is what makes me anxious. Anyone else like this?
