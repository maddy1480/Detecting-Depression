IOP?
So my parents and therapist have been pushing for IOP for my anxiety and depression. Not for eating disorder, that is being treated separately in outpatient. It's group therapy, 3 hours a day. I think it's virtual, if not, in the hospital. I read that it's lead by a psychiatrist who does assessments and diagnosis and there are therapists. Not sure what to think. I don't really want to do it. I have social anxiety and trust issues so group therapy is not for me. I'd either say nothing or lie my ass off. But at the same time, my depression is getting much worse and I'm not on meds bc my parents don't want me to. But there's a psychiatrist there so the only positive I can see is maybe considering meds bc my depression is out of my control, but I could also just discuss this with my primary care doc who knows about my mental health conditions.  I also feel bad about saying no bc my therapist wants me to do IOP. Oh right, and my body image issues are so bad that I can't imagine being on a Zoom call with a bunch of strangers when I am so ugly. Anyone have advice?
