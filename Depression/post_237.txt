Hey yall a depressed dumbass chomped her phone and broke itttt lets goooo
So basically my depression and anxiety is soo very bad lately henceforth i am extremely irritable, angry, and on edge and everything is very upsetty sphateggtti. Long story short I was trying to start the hotspot on my phone and that dumb bitch had the audacity to not work so I may or may not have chomped down on my phone because I am resorting to my primal instincts here. Chomped too hard --> phone screen cracked --> i have glass in my teeth. You may ask, what type of 15 year old would do that? A very mentally ill one with no emotional regulation and is not medicated, obviously. Lol I just have the tendency to take out my frustration on myself (self harm) or on other objects. Will tell my dad I just dropped my phone, off my loft bed, to make it more believable. Wow I am such a fucking idiot :) Just another day in the life of mental illness <3 Anyone else like this or is it just me?? Do you guys ever get The Urge to hurt an object out of frusturation or irritability? I feel like a stupid little kid
