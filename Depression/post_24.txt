Do any of you have times where you feel like your anxiety is going away, and then you step out of your comfort zone, just to realize you’re still feeling the same?
There are times when I feel a bit comfortable with myself, mostly when I’m with my girlfriend, but outside of that, I feel like my anxiety is still the same whenever I go out in public and surrounded by a lot of people. I’m taking my medication for anxiety and I honestly can’t tell if I’m doing better from when I first started taking them. My mom is now upset with me because I told her my meds aren’t working and she just tells me that it’s all in my head, that I give myself the anxiety, that I just need to think positively. I want to tell my doctor, but I don’t know if I can bring myself to do it.
