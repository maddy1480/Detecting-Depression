[7 month diagnosis follow up] i’m quite possibly in the best physical shape of my life, still need to work on mental shape just a little bit.
in-person school is back and in full swing, the sun is out, gyms are open, no s/h or excessive alcohol in 4+ months, pretty awesome stuff. i got recommended to a job by a very good friend of mine so i’m basically guaranteed a spot if i apply, which means i would finally have a decent source of income. so far, so good!
