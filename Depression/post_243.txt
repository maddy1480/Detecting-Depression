New to therapy, diagnosis, and antidepressants
I was diagnosed with adjustment disorder with depression and anxiety last week.  After talking to my doctor yesterday she prescribed Zoloft and hydroxyzine.  I took the hydroxyzine last night before bed and the Zoloft this morning and I feel AWFUL! I feel like I was hit by a truck.  Other than taking a bath and a short dog walk, I have been sleeping all day and my brain feels like it's misfiring or in slow motion.  I feel nauseous, but somehow have an appetite for the first time in weeks.

My therapist keeps stressing that I need a support system in the town I live in, but it's just not that easy to make friends as an adult in a pandemic, especially moving every 2-3 years.

I'm reading Atomic Habits, Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents, and Daughter Detox right now.  Atomic Habits seems unrealistic in my present state, but I'm hoping to apply it somehow.  If anyone has any reading suggestions that deal with anxiety or depression please drop them below.
