Should I just give up?
Should I give up thinking I might succeed at something? Should I give up trying? Should I forget about trying to earn a living and let myself be on the streets to die in a ditch somewhere? Should I just let my wife and kid take care of themselves without me around to annoy them?

Should I just give up on life as a whole?
