Sometimes I wonder if when I’m depressed if I’m actually at my truest self
This pretty much stems from since I was diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder and was basically told that in my case it’s a personality disorder so depression is my personality. Thus I wonder if I’m only truly my natural self when I’m depressed.
