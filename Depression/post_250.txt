Understanding my diagnosis
4 years ago, I was diagnosed with depression. I was at an extremely low point in my life, and I couldn't see things getting any better. Years later though, things have gotten better. My mood has become much more regulated on a day to day basis, and I no longer recognize the person that I was when I was at my lowest. However, I still have bad days. I still have periods in time where things just seem bleak and hopeless. 

I guess I don't really know what to make of my diagnosis now. Is depression something that stays with you forever, kind of coming and going in waves? At this point in my life, it doesn't feel like something that is always with me on daily basis. It definitely creeps in sometimes, but it hasn't fully taken over my like it did in the past. This may be a stupid question but I just want to understand it better.
