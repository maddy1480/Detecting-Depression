Help, my mind is mess right now, maybe i'm not having the right diagnosis or it's just rejecting it
So, here's the thing, almost two months ago, I've been diagnosed with depression (is not severe) the thing is that is something that I can work on it, when I received that diagnosis I was okay with that because for me was making sense of why I've been feeling like that, but then suddenly I've been having these ups and downs (?) Like there are times where can be 2 o 3 or even a month where I'm fine, everything is just great, but then changes,  then I started to feel empty, tired, angry and all of that, I've been reading about ciclotimia and I think I match with some symptoms but idk if that can be true. and then my parents keep telling me that I don't have nothing, that I'm fine, so all of that just makes me feel more confused and idk what to do. I feel so lost

Let me know if u have any experience with ciclotimia if  that happens to u (I can be wrong with the idea of ciclotimia so help to understand) or let me know any advice please.

Thanks
