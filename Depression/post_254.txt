List of things for when you're depressed
So I wrote a note to myself of things to do/not do when I feel depressed, to try and lift my mood. Edited it a bit and decided to post it on here as it may benefit someone else. Some of them apply to just feeling a little down, some for when I'm feeling suicidal. The list is In no particular order.
Its just something I decided to do after my last depressive episode to try and remind myself of the good when it feels like there is truly no hope.
 I think it's a worthwhile thing to write out when you're in a good/normal state of mind and keep on your phone. Some might seem obvious but sometimes as soon as depression hits it distorts your perception of everything, and these things may become less obvious. I suffer from cyclothymia aswell as depression so some of the mood ones may not be as relevant but overall I feel there are things in there that apply to most people. Feel free to add your own ðŸ˜Š


â–ªï¸ŽTry making a plan for the day. Recognise that depression can make tiny things feel impossible.Give yourself one thing to accomplish (no matter how small) and be proud of yourself for doing that one thing. E.g brushing your teeth/showering, getting dressed, sitting outside or a work assignment if you're feeling up to it.

â–ªï¸Ž if you have pets, go and play and cuddle with them. If not try calling a friend

â–ªï¸ŽDont think about all the things you havnt gotten done regarding school/work. Youre not well enough to tackle that now and will only end up making yourself feel worse. Park it and decide to make a plan when you're feeling better and are able to cope. Only think about this moment, and how you can make yourself feel better now.

â–ªï¸ŽCall a helpline in your country, talking can make a big difference, even if you don't feel like it right now.

â–ªï¸ŽTry taking an ice cold shower, your brain will be forced to focus on the inconvenience of the temperature, and it may distract you from upsetting thoughts/feelings.

â–ªï¸Žif you can get up and exercise vigorously. Choose fast paced music and play it loud. This might help vent out anger/emotional pain.

â–ªï¸Ž You may be feeling very trapped but remind yourself that distressing feeling can pass, and your thoughts aren't always true.

â–ªï¸ŽA crisis may not last longer than a few hours, but when you're in it it will feel like life has and always will be this way.  Depression will make you discount the positive days and achievements you have made lately. Write these down so you can credit yourself. 

â–ªï¸ŽTake it one day/minute/hour at a time.Dont think and how long it's going to be like this for, instead distract yourself. 

â–ªï¸ŽAs tempting as it is try not to isolate yourself in your room. It will probably make you feel more isolated and depressed and you may end up feeling like you have wasted the day, and feel worse about yourself 

â–ªï¸Žif you really cannot get out of bed then try listening  or watching something you enjoy on YouTube or netflix. ( I like family guy ðŸ˜„) Don't watch anything depressing.

â–ªï¸ŽOpen the blinds to let some light in, don't sit in the dark with your thoughts.

â–ªï¸Ž Don't compare yourself to others. If the most you've done all day is keep yourself safe then that's something to be proud of. Don't feel like your lazy because you feel you havnt been as 'productive' as someone else.

â–ªï¸ŽTry drawing or writing out how you feel. It can just be scribbles if you want it to be. Expressing your feelings cab be relieving.

â–ªï¸ŽGet off social media and do something to care for yourself. You may not feel like you deserve it but do something nice for yourself. E.g. take a bath with candles and skincare, snuggle up and watch an interesting film/ video that you can give your attention to.

â–ªï¸Ž if you are feeling up to it go for a walk, or go for a drive with some music on.

â–ªï¸ŽMoods can be chemical. They're not  a reflection of you and theyre not final. Depression an illness and when it's strikes may be out of your control. You're not weak for struggling with it, infact quite the opposite.

â–ªï¸ŽEven tho it seems impossible your mood may change again in a few minutes or a few hours and you may feel better. Keep fighting it.

â–ªï¸ŽThink any good/stable times that you've had in the past.  Was there anything about them that made them particularly good? Can you implement this into your life now? Remind yourself that depression can come and go, and therse a good chance you won't feel this way forever.

â–ªï¸ŽTry to make a list of the positive things in your life, even if there are very little. it can be things like a good food you ate, the feeling of sunshine and being in nature, or a new song you like.

â–ªï¸ŽIf you're feeling up to it then think about the situation you're in and if therse anything you can do to improve it. E.g make an appointment with your doctor, adjust meds, change meds/doctor. Anything that you can see having a positive impact on the future.
