⚠️TW: Self-Harm⚠️
About one month ago I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I’ve “known” that i’ve suffered from depression and anxiety for a while but I just got diagnosed. The psychiatrist also prescribed me prozac because he was concerned it would get worse if we didn’t treat it immediately. Despite a professional telling me what I already knew, I still have doubt about it and worry that i’m just being dramatic and maybe even making my symptoms up. Due to this i’ve recently started to cut myself.
