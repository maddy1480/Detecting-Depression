I can’t do this anymore
I have absolutely zero motivation to do any of my school work and I don’t know if i’m going to be able to get it all done now. What’s really bad about this is that my self worth comes from my grades and if they start to drop i’ll hate myself even more than I already do and everything will be ruined. I just want to drop out or transfer schools so I can graduate (i go to a magnet school so my school is much harder than the other schools in my county and we are held to a higher standard and this also means that we can’t graduate early like you can at other schools in my county) early since I have all of my credits
