Depression has stolen my life from me and it's too late to reboot
I won't bore you all with the excruciating details, but basically, I was diagnosed with major depression when I was 16. I'm 33 now. To date, I have accomplished nothing. I got my BA in a useless field and an MA in an even more useless field. I have no real skills. I can write, but so can most people. I live in a rundown area with no opportunities. I share an apartment with my mom, who relies on me for so much. It's mutual, though; my only income is what I scrape together writing online. I wouldn't be able to make it on my own. 

I want to move to reboot my life, but I just feel like it's too late. I've wasted my life and I'm going to just *keep* wasting it until I die. The only places I can afford to move with my savings are places where jobs are hard to come by, and that won't help me. The places where the jobs are...? You guessed it. Way too expensive. It's especially depressing looking at Craigslist ads for roommates and everyone wants students or new grads and I'm forced to acknowledge how I've been rotting all this time. 

I'm so scared of trying and failing. I fail at everything. Some days I think if I could just pick up and start over somewhere new, maybe that would give me the jump start I need to get my life back on track. But then I remember I'm a loser and will just keep sabotaging myself like I always do.
