I wan to either start over or game over now.
Back again. I've been here a few times, and it's still the same old problems. Still a loser in her early 30s, still unemployed, still stuck with two utterly useless degrees, still broke, still trying to support her disabled mom by herself, still just dealing with a lot.

It's just reaching a breaking point. I want to start over. I know where I messed up my life. I need to go back and fix it, but I can't, and I can't forgive myself and move on. So it needs to end. I'm too big of a coward to ever actually kill myself, and I couldn't do that to my mom anyway. But if I could just find a way to not exist anymore...

How do I find the courage to change? How do I learn to forgive myself for mistakes I can't fix? How do I stop being so jealous of everyone else for having the basic trappings of adulthood when I'm just barely functioning and waiting out the next few decades until my body finally just gives out? How do I keep going when I just want it to stop?  


\*And now I notice the title is misspelled. Lovely. Sorry about that.
