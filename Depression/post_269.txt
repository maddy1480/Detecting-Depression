Can't accept my diagnosis of MDD (please help me understand)
Kinda ranting but need help: 

I don't really know. I've been battling this for so long. I've been diagnosed with depression but it just feel like I am feeling sorry for myself and becoming a bad person. It's not like I have the regular depression symptoms of no appetite, can't sleep, can't get out of bed, crying all day. None of that. I just see the world differently. I just feel so out of it. I no longer care about other's feelings. I no longer care about anything.

 I feel guilty cuz I think I brought myself to this point, I felt sorry for myself, and was so anxious for so long that I hit a point where I was just afraid of my reality. I didn't wanna accept my reality. And that was this whole issue. That has Brought me this "depression" diagnosis but it doesn't feel like depression. I feel like I'm making it up or have become softer as I've gotten older. 5 years ago I wouldn't have let this happen to myself 

I just see the world so differently. I care about nothing, I don't recognize my family, I'm afraid to talk to people who have been friends of mine for a long time. I wanted to be depressed to explain my shitty reality so I convinced myself I was depressed and now I can't step away from it. I've convinced all the doctors too.  they have me on Zoloft and Wellbutrin. they don't do shit though except make me exhausted and feel more out of it. them not working only makes me feel like I'm not depressed in the first place. 

Will other antidepressants help me? Am I depressed?
