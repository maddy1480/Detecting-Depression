doctors telling me I have depression had only made it worse *need to rant*
Need to rant and don't wanna write in my journal. would love some help and thoughts tho.

I wasn't feeling myself for a while and was advised to seek help. I've now been in therapy for 5 months and it has made it so much worse. they diagnosed me with depression and anxiety but that just gives a label to my inability to cope. they are enabling me. they are keeping me from taking responsibility and my life and telling me that's it not my fault. someone needs to look at it and tell me hey! it is your fault, that's okay, but you need to fix this. 

I'm tired of my therapist and psychiatrist making excuses and making me feel even worse by making me believe I am mentally ill. you only are what you believe. 

depression is a real thing that affects millions. I know that. it is super disabling. but I don't think I suffer like so many. it makes me feel like such an asshole to be taking meds and being labeled depressed when there are others out there who truly suffer. I'm just some weak kid from the upper middle class who is getting enabled by the doctors and therapists around him. the world is easy on me and that's why I cower away when it gets difficult. I'm sorry to all those who really suffer, I'm a disgrace to the depression community. my case is really just one of being weak. 

I know depression isn't weakness, depression is an illness. but weakness is still out there. and he's writing this post. and he doesn't have depression.
