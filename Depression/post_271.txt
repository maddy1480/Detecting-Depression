*Need some help please* Is there a chance I'm just emotionally weak?
I'm strugglnig.

I understand depression is something totally different. I've been diagnosed with depression. I just worry that I don't actually have it. like maybe I've slipped through the cracks. I feel like I'm just avoiding reality. My depression doesn't feel like what I thought depression would feel like. I just feel so disconnected from myself and everyone around me. I just feel like I'm in some alternate space of the universe. 

I've been put in therapy and antidepressants and nothing is helping me. It's making me feel worse actually. Because it allows me to avoid the reality that put me in depression. If I've been diagnosed with clinical depression, is there a chance they're wrong? I don't have much hope in getting better.
