*Please advice* I don't think I'm depressed. I simple don't feel myself.
It's odd. I've been diagnosed with depression but I don't really experience most of the depression symptoms. I just don't feel like myself. Is that depression? I'm not sad or unhappy, I just don't feel "right". 

My therapist and psychiatrist have diagnosed me with MDD but I think that's just cause I told them what I wanted them to hear. I don't know if I was completely honest. I wanted to be called depressed cuz idk what else could be going on. But here I am, months later after being on medication, not feeling much different. 

I don't know if I ever had depression. I think it is something else. I tricked myself into this mental state. idk.  does depression sometimes not feel like what you think it would?
