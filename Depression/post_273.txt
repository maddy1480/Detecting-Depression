Doubting my diagnosis
I'm having a really bad time lately. Even though I've been diagnosed with depression I keep feeling like I'm faking it. I'm almost obsessed with online test just to reassure myself that I'm actually depressed. And still I fear that I've just manipulated my therapist into thinking  I'm depressed.  
Does anyone else do this? Or am I actually just manipulative asshole who feels sorry for myself.
