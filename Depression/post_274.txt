BPD Diagnosis, Friends with Caring Relationships and Going home to an abusive family... now what?
Sorry folks, this will be a long one...

Last month I was diagnosed with BPD and have felt depressed and wistful. I was hospitalized last month for suicidal ideation and things still suck, but admittedly not as distressing as last month. After I was discharged, I wanted to find a job in Boston and stay with a friend... didn’t happen. It’s been a month and I have nothing to show for being discharged other than going home to a family that coddles my abuser and defends him. 

I also realize I am codependent, too. This makes my relationships unstable as I always cave in to others’ needs and never stand my ground... this combined with my hatred of loneliness. I know the pandemic necessitates distance, but I feel so lonely and uncared for. It seems like a lot of people have caring relationships to look forward to. My friend informed me she was dating someone she was satisfied with and I’m like damn.... why can’t I have that, someone to take care of me and to love in a healthy way? It’s because I’m a fucking mess that no one wants and my codependency fucks up relationships.

I really want someone to physically love me, but that’s not going to happen for a long time. And since I’m returning to my abusive home... now what? I’m doing better than July (where I’d be on r/suicidewatch), but I’m depressed because codependency sucks and I soon will have no physical support network.
