Confused about my diagnosis
Hello! I'm quite new to this subreddit but i thought this might be a good place to gain some insight. Last October i was diagnosed with persistent depressive disorders and recently, waa prescribed antidepressants for the symptoms. However recently I've been feeling better than i did at the time of my diagnosis (i went through a horrible depressive episode on and from July up to late September) so i feel like it doesn't apply to me anymore. I've also had friends who have worse episodes than me so i also feel like since im no longer at that level of "low", I'm not really depressed. My doctor says it's normal to be confused, especially when my symptoms say otherwise, but part of me feels like im overreacting and I'm good. Would really like some tips or advice especially from anyone with the same diagnosis. My counselor calls it "functional depression" that's why i don't think it affects me when it actually does.
