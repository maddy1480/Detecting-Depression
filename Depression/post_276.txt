My appointment with my psychiatrist lasted about 2 hours
Hello to all.

As I expressed in a previous post , I have an "special" psychiatrist which is particularly obsessed with the fact that I have schizophrenia (he is wrong).

First of all, he made me apologies for having said me about 4 months ago that I had schizophrenia for have gained weight, explained here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/gpqsd3/i\_reckon\_i\_have\_depression\_but\_ive\_been\_diagnosed/](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/gpqsd3/i_reckon_i_have_depression_but_ive_been_diagnosed/)

. But after two hours of insisting him that I don't have symptons, he insisted in the belief I have schizophrenia.

During two hours I said him for instance that:

I didn't endure an special trauma from childhoold (i didn't lose my daddy or mum when I was a kid, I didn't go through with an intense bullying).

Not taking drugs.

Not  hallucinations , no delusions.

I haven't ever heard voices, not thinking in conspiracy against me.

Besides, **I don't show** another **negative symptons** that I have read in a book about schizophrenia such as:

**Weakness  affective**: don't respond with emotions to the positive or negative events that happens surrounding me.

**Poverty  thought**:  e.g. to respond with  monosyllables.

**Loss of vitality**.

**Social isolation**: it comes easily to me to make new friends. No shyness.

**Weird behavior**: I wear normal clothes, I haven't ever got naked in public, I maintain a proper hygiene, my room is tidy and so on.

He intends that I take medication for schizophrenia on a month basis during my whole life, but it doesn't make any sense to me due to my case, and I don't have quarrels at home.

I will see him next time in three months.

I am intending to attend to a second specialist, but not another public psychiatrist (they communicate with the same information) I will go to a private one.

My daddy didn't support me at all. I reckon he wants to hear I am crazy in order to live my whole live with them, he doesn't care if I will have a job one day or not, but  with the idea I won't cause problems while taking medication.

However I won't receive injections any longer.

All what I want is to have a job, and to live independent from my parents and doctors, not bearing anyone and not having someone to say what I have to do or not.

Thanks for reading me.

One hug

An spanish  Sagittarian.

Postscript: My doctor gave me away a book (about schizophrenia).
