Have you listened about Rosenhan experiment? Sane people with a bias diagnosis of crazy ones
>The **Rosenhan experiment** or **Thud experiment** was conducted to determine the validity of [psychiatric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatry) [diagnosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis). The experimenters feigned hallucinations to enter psychiatric hospitals, and acted normally afterwards. They were diagnosed with psychiatric disorders and were given [antipsychotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) drugs. The study was conducted by [psychologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist) [David Rosenhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rosenhan), a Stanford University professor, and published by the journal [*Science*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_(journal)) in 1973 under the title "On being sane in insane places".[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenhan_experiment#cite_note-Gaughwin-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenhan_experiment#cite_note-Rosenhan-2) It is considered an important and influential criticism of psychiatric diagnosis.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenhan_experiment#cite_note-Slater-3)

>Rosenhan's study was done in eight parts. The first part involved the use of healthy associates or "pseudopatients" (three women and five men, including Rosenhan himself) who briefly feigned auditory hallucinations in an attempt to gain admission to 12 psychiatric hospitals in five states in the United States. All were admitted and diagnosed with psychiatric disorders. After admission, the pseudopatients acted normally and told staff that they felt fine and had no longer experienced any additional hallucinations. All were forced to admit to having a mental illness and had to agree to take antipsychotic drugs as a condition of their release. The average time that the patients spent in the hospital was 19 days. All but one were diagnosed with schizophrenia "in remission" before their release.

How many people do you think will there have with a false diagnosis of " schizophrenic  person" who is really a sane ones?

I reckon that loads of people, currently screwed by the fucking  antipsychotic's (which cause more damage than the positive effects that are supposed to have).
