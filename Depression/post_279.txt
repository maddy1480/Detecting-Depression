A matter about stigma. I don't understand my psychiatrist and his obsession with me being a schizophrenic
Hello to all.

As I stated in a long thread this week

[https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/gxc03h/my\_appointment\_with\_my\_psychiatrist\_lasted\_about/](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/gxc03h/my_appointment_with_my_psychiatrist_lasted_about/)

I talked with my psychiatrist who is particularly obsessed with the fact that I have schizophrenia (he is wrong).

As I posted before, I don't show another negative symptons that I have read in a book about schizophrenia (  "[Schizophrenia - Open the doors](https://www.amazon.es/ESQUIZOFRENIA-Asociaci%C3%B3n-Psiquiatr%C3%ADa-descriminaci%C3%B3n-esquizofrenia/dp/B00F3LJRZK/ref=sr_1_2?__mk_es_ES=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=esquizofrenia+abre+las+puertas&qid=1591593582&sr=8-2)" in spanish ) such as:

Weakness affective; Poverty thought; Loss of vitality; Social isolation or Weird behavior amongst others.

All in all, I forgot to say that he affirmed that I have a bad prediction, bad signs that could lead to become schizophrenic as the fact that **I am** a **man** and **single** with **40**.

Previous appointment he said I showed **another symptom** which is that “**I neglected my physical condition, gaining weight**”.

I am totally aware that I must go to another psychiatrist, but I don't understand why is he so absolutely convinced that I am crazy when my brain works well.

&#x200B;

Maybe for having spent four months during two times in a sanatorium? Can't I flee from this stigma any longer?
