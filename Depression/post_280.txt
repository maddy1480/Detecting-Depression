I am overcoming with my depression, my supposed "mental illness" and I explain how.
Neil Strauss, a well-known American author, journalist and [ghostwriter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostwriter) said in one of his last tweets: 

" I believe depression is legitimate. But I also believe that if you don’t exercise, eat nutritious food, get sunlight, get enough sleep, consume positive material, surround yourself with support, then you aren’t giving yourself a fighting chance.  –" quoted extracted by Jim Carrey.

Well, since I have forsaken my injections, follow an strict diet, going to the gym and keep positive habits, my mood have changed. I turned into another person, I am living how if I wouldn't have depression or another mental illness, being mentally focused in living as a sane person and my life is changing to better.

If you internalize that you are a schizoprenic person, a depressed man or similar, you behave like is supposed to behave one guy like this, discouraged to do anything, with secondary symptons or telling others you are this kind of guy, you will live in a constant spiral of negativity.

Whereas if you think yourself you are strong enough as another person of your age and with your same  *intelligence quotient* (*IQ*) , mental health takes a secondary level, leaves in the background.

Repeating yourself these positive statements  (supported by others telling you them as well) I have gained a date today (with a good prediction) and I have driven first time in 5 years.
