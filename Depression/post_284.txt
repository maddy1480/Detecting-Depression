People are ghosting me since my diagnosis of schizophrenia
I guess the post is pretty self explanatory, i had a psychotic break i guess. Deleted all social apps, now i feel a bit better. Explained to people about why i lost their snapchat streaks and why i wasn't replying. I was just ghosted. I mean they're online and talking to other people. One person was a girl I thought I could open up to as well. I guess the stigma of Schizophrenia is still strong. I have close friends left but i still can't say it doesn't hurt to lose friends. The worst thing is the voices in my head keep blaming me for them doing that and I guess its not wrong. I don't know I guess i just want some reassurance from here
