What I Have Learned from my MDD Diagnosis
I thought it might be helpful to some, and beneficial for myself, to go over some of the things I've learned since being professionally diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder. Most of these things have come from personal reflection, and some from research. This is not a clinical examination, but a personal inventory of sorts.

My greatest caveat is that my life is not your life. If something here is insightful for you, great. If it isn't, that's fine. We are not in competition.

1. I don't have to lie about how I'm feeling. I can feel like shit and say that. It's honest and forthright. Most people find it confusing when I say it with a smile.

2. Depression is my problem, not anyone else's.  That is to say, I don't expect people to understand,  to tolerate, or be able to help with my depression. I am responsible for seeking help. I am not entitled to drag people into my problems.

3. My brain is deficient. My neurochemistry and my neurological structure do not operate properly. I think and feel in a number of ways that are fundamentally different than most around me.

4. I don't need to justify my choices based on imagined expectations or standards. I can just say that I'm tired. I can say I don't have the energy. I don't owe anyone my energy.

5. Tomorrow is possibility. I do not cling to hope, but I always remind myself that tomorrow is unknown. To believe it can be nothing but misery is giving depression a voice it doesn't deserve. Yes. I will be depressed tomorrow. Good things may also happen.

6. I don't have to be normal. This is most difficult, because I am still relearning what normal should be for my own health and limits.

If you have questions or responses, they are welcome. I am not likely to reply quickly. Do not confuse a slowness with a lack of care.
