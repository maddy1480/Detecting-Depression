New diagnosis
Just returned from my doctor for a routine physical. They have a survey you fill out with the nurse asking about mental health. My answers were extreme enough that the doctor brought it up during her time with me. I was aware that I had some sort of mild depression but I responded well to a low dose antidepressant. However life has been very unfair lately to my family and I and my anxiety has been through the roof constantly. I can’t sleep and when I do finally get to sleep I’m out for HOURS. I barely eat and when I do eat I binge like it’s nobody’s business. My hair has been falling out at an alarming rate. My level of self care is almost nonexistent. I find myself thinking if I died all of these problems would stop. I have to snap myself out of it when those thoughts come. I lost somebody in my family last fall to suicide and we’re still trying to pick up the pieces from it. She diagnosed me with a major depressive episode and strongly urged me to seek counseling. I’ve seen a counselor before but I told her right now with everything going on I don’t have the time to take care of myself. I know I need to go and am hoping to find a time that I can go and vent. But right now I just want to go lay in bed for a few hours.
