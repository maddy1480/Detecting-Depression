I've just been diagnosed with a mild depression
For the past year I have been feeling empty, and stopped caring about things. I am disenchanted with my hobbies, job and everything else. I thought it was just tiredness or anything else, to be honest due to pandemic I don't go out much (I have breathing issues and an 80 year old mum I have to take care of) and I thought it was getting to me.  
Last saturday I finally broke down crying for a silly thing with my girlfriend.  
During the past year I had several friends asking me if I was okay, and I just kept telling them I had too many things in my mind lately, and that it would be okay.

The doctor basically asked me a bunch of questionnaire questions and said "yeah, mild depression. Have some pills and let's check again in 6 months." as if it was the common cold. I asked him if I should talk to a therapist, if that would help and he simply said "nah, I don't think so"  


 I haven't started taking the pills yet, still getting my mind around it.

This shit is scary.

Sorry if that breaks some kind of rule, I just had to tell someone.
