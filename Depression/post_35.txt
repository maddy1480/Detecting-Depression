“You aren’t depressed you are asking for attention”
That is what someone told me when I posted on my story about how bad my depression has become these past months I have diagnosed depression and it did get extremely bad I lost my job because of it my house is a mess I stopped eating I stopped doing tasks it was a really hard time and I just needed to vent somewhere I didn’t write too much I just explained that it’s very hard dealing with depression as a young adult who has adult responsibilities to also look after. I wasn’t looking for attention because I just wanted to vent I also posted it on a private story but I allowed some people to join by clicking on the join my story option on snap. They sent that and I asked why do they believe this if they don’t know me personally? They said because I’m too attractive to have a mental illness and I’m definitely one of those girls who say they have it to get attention from men. What? I just needed to vent because I didn’t know what else to do I didn’t care if no one saw it. I didn’t dnt respond to them because I didn’t nt think it was necessary to keep the conversation going but it did hurt. Just because I’m “attractive” which I don’t believe because I’m very insecure tbh doesn’t mean I can’t be depressed idk I just didn’t understand it. I’m not mean to anyone I don’t talk to anyone besides my two best friends and my bf I keep to myself so idk who this girl was to say that but oh well I guess I just wanted to say something about this
