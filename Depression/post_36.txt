Idk how to feel about this
So I called out of my job due to a bad depression day like really bad I’ve come in every day this was the first time I had called off. When I came back my next shift my boss came up to me and said we got slammed and you should not of called out I said I’m sorry but I was dealing with my depression that entire day it was hard to even get out of bed they told me the world doesn’t revolve around you and that was selfish and welcome to adult life. I’ve felt like shit after tbh.
