I really want to be happy, I've never known how
I've been diagnosed with depression from when I was 9. A lot has to do with my genetics but I know a lot has to do with my lifestyle and mentality.

I want to live better in a way that is conducive to being happy. I live with my parents but they are unloving and lead dull lives and I'd developed my first symptoms as a child obviously because of their mentality they passed onto me. I want to be positive and happy and energetic and ambitious. I am struggling to be ambitious and inspired. I dont care about anything at all. I don't want to be rich or healthy, I don't care about goals or attempt to achieve them at all.

I do not watch or consume any art or media that gives me joy. I listen to music but it doesnt give me joy. I have no dependents.

I work out but i never have goals because I do not care to achieve anything at all.

I keep going in circles and speak very negative words all the time. I feel stuck in my negativity and I feel sick of myself. I feel sick of the obsessive thoughts. My family struggles too, but they have no self awareness enought o understand their depression is because of their actions.

I canxt get a dog because my house is very hot, the animal will suffer at home. 

I work full time. I don't play games or watch movies or do anything "fun".

I like alcohol. And I like dressing nice. That's about it. Nothing joy inducing.
