I’m just lazy
My therapist diagnosed me with major depression and had my mother schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist to see if I needed any medication. I had a meeting with the psychiatrist and she told me that I couldn’t have depression because I enjoyed to play video games and listen to music sometimes, and she also told my mother that I was just being lazy . She tried to scare me out of telling her if I was suicidal by telling me that if I was she’d have to call the hospital and put me away because I was sick. 
I don’t like her what do I do ?

Edit: thank you all for your advice and suggestions, I told my mom about what she said and my mom agreed that the psychiatrist probably doesn’t know what she was talking about
