Grocery stores...
It just happened.
My Mother wanted to shop some groceries and she asked me if I could go with her. So I did, it's not that I hate going to a supermarket, sometimes I really do enjoy strolling through the aisles.
Only if we go to our local grocery store it's uncomfy for me because there could be ppl i know, etc., the usal social anxiety stuff.
So I went to this local store although my hair looked bad I didn't felt that great.
So as soon as we arrived there I felt this weird feeling in my guts. Suddenly there were some teens and I felt so hyperaware of myself, I thought I was standing weird, I just was weird. Everything. I felt ashamed of myself, I even got embarrassed about my anti-qnxiety rings. I started to think somebody's talking about me... like this feeling of being judged. It was too real. I just wanted to go, just go. My Mother didn't like how I acted, she asked me if I wanted anything else, but I denied.
then she asked me in the car what was going on, but I didn't want to talk, she wouldn't got it anyway.

Why does it have to be like this? why...

TLDR: Went to local grocery store with my Mother, had a panic attack (?) and just wanted to get home.
