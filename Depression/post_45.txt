Social Isolation and my situation
Hey, It's me again...  
I received good news but still the situation is pretty weird i guess.

At first, since i joined this subreddit and r/depression i feel like there is a little spark of hope. Thank you for being so nice, kind and helpful towards me, I really appreciate it to the bottom of my heart.  


Now to my Situation and the problems... I'm not only suffering from social anxiety but also from depression which I was diagnosed with a few days ago. It's kind of a relieve because i finally have words for these things that haunting me for a long time. I also got suggested going in impatiently therapy, which for the first time in years gives me a light over the horizon; but also i'm fearing it...

I have little to no social interactions. Only 3 somewhat close friends: one rl social contact and two online contacts. I'm scared to talk to persons in any way, especially because I'm afraid of being myself as myself (If you know what i mean...). I need to change that, so uhm, if you wanna text me, i linked my discord tag in my profile (you don't have to text tho of course :ooo) and sorry if I need time responding .\_.  


Stay safe and strong you all <333
