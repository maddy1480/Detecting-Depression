Newly diagnosed with depression
I'm on my third relapse with panic disorder and agoraphobic avoidance. After working with my therapist and psychiatrist, I was recently diagnosed with depression. Being an extrovert and by default a happy outgoing person, I'm really struggling with these new feelings of being sad and down. It's definitely making healing from my primary condition more difficult. What are some you all do to help get through depression. Thanks everyone
