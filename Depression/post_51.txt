I just got diagnosed and started taking my meds
Hi, I’m new at this. I was diagnosed with severe clinical depression fairly recently. I have started taking my antidepressant (fluoxetine) about 1 and a half weeks ago. I haven’t been feeling any good change yet, just the side effects (nausea, loss of appetite). I had a huge breakdown yesterday, too. I’m starting to doubt the medication but I also understand that it may need time before it kicks in. 

I guess my question is, how long does it take for this to work, usually? And why does everything feel the same way still?

Would love to hear your experiences.
