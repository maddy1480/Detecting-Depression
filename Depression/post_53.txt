I hate life and nothing helps me
I am diagnosed with depression, adhd and anxiety. I take meds and go to therapy. I eat healthy and sleep 8 hours. I work out at gym. Still I feel down all the time, I don't enjoy anything, I don't like anything, everything makes me bored. Nothing interests me. Should I just kill myself?
