not feeling anything at all
I am 21 years old and have been diagnosed with depression. 

I never had any bad moments in my life that could have caused it. The most common symptoms of depression are sadness, crying, not sleeping, and worrying. 

But in my case, I don't feel anything and I sleep like a baby. I went to the doctor because I was not feeling love, joy, laughter, sadness, connection with people around me, and emptiness. However, I ended up being diagnosed with depression. 

  
I would love to hear from your experience and if it's a common occurrence in depression.
