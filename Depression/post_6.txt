Diagnosed with MDD and a few more things. I just feel like there's something more that hasn't been brought up yet and I need to ask you all about it.
So I (f16) am formally diagnosed with MDD. I feel like many treatments haven't worked. I don't know why. And I'm not always depressed. But when I get depressed the episodes are severe and last up to a year with SI. I have moments where I sleep all the time like all day and all night. And during those times I don't do anything, just sleep. 
But I also have moments when I'm the complete opposite . Like I will have so many racing thoughts and ideas about so many things I want to do and then I get hyperfixated on those things. And I don't sleep literally at all and don't even feel tired. During these episodes (idk what you'd call them) I can stay up for multiple days on end without sleeping. I've gone 4 full days with 0 sleep. But that entire episode lasted a few weeks (this was a few years ago, but I've had more times like this) When I'm in this state I have literally deep cleaned my room, baked a cake and did my laundry all in the middle of the night and still had energy the next day. 
I really don't know what this is and I don't like not knowing. And my meds don't even help. My depression isn't fixed when I'm on them. I take prozac but it only helps my ocd and anxiety. I don't know what to do and i don't know if it's normal. Who do I talk to about this? What could this be? Any answers help!
