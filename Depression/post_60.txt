Diagnosed w/ severe depression in 2018, diagnosed with neurological disorder 3 days ago.
I’ve always had good and bad days with depression. Along with a lot of other symptoms that are now explained by my recent diagnosis. I am now experiencing a side of depression I’ve never seen within myself. I do not feel like going into detail, but if anyone can sympathize with the ever changing thing that I am experiencing.
