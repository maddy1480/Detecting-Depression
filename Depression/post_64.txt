I feel like an impostor
I've been living for depression for 1 year and a half now. Therapy and medication haven't worked so far for me, but I keep telling my depressed friends to get help and seek medical advice. I feel like an impostor: how can I tell them to seek help, when I'm not better after fighting for one year?
