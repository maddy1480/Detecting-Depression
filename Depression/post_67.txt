I just want to know if anyone can relate to my story.
So, i have this uncle who's really strict and thinks whatever he says is right. When he talks to me, I can never relax. I always feel like he's going to yell at me or say something that would upset me. So basically he gives me anxiety even just looking at him makes me nervous. He would ask me to drive him somewhere and it doesn't matter if it's near or far, he would give me instructions all the way. I could never drive like i normally drive just because I'm so anxious and nervous. At the end of the day my anxiety level is way higher than it would normally be and I get horrible back pain out of this. I've been promising myself that I would just say no the next time he asks, but I'm too scared or feel sorry for him. I don't know what to do.
