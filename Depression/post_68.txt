So, I had been diagnosed with depression and OCD.
So, I had been diagnosed with depression and OCD and have been given medication. I recently collapsed and had a seizure... My family was shocked and terrified that they told me to stop the medication and I did consult the doctor before doing this. I'm just really curious about whether it was because of the medication or something else. Since I'd never had seizures before. Ever since I stopped taking meds I'd been having trouble sleeping, vivid dreams, sweating after waking up from a dream. Has anyone experienced anything like this? And does anyone know why this happened to me?
