i've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder today, i'm terrified of the meds..
my doctor prescribed **venlafaxine** which is an antidepressant, but when i learned about it it was terrifying, so many people had really horrible withdrawal syndromes and a lot of mentions of "brain zapping" if they miss it by even 10 minutes, i am really scared to take this, i have adhd and i know that i am gonna forget to take it, can you guys please share the experience you had with this antidepressant.. is the stuff that i'm reading real or am i just paranoid...
