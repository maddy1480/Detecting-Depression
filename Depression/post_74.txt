I got spanked as a child
 I want to let this out. Ever since I was a child, I got traumatized by my childhood days. I was a terrible child back then because of my jealousy and people bullying me for my looks. I stole something in school and it was a thing my classmate owned. It happened that my classmates told it to my parents and my dad spanked me afterwards and I tried to tell them what happened but they said that I dont have manners and your answering me back. I cried loudly and they tempted me to quiet down because neighbors will hear my crying. It traumatized me the spanking and when my parents calmed down they said that they did it because they love me like wtf?? here your daughter developed a mental illness and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder due to traumatic experiences. Yes I fucking deserve to be hit by my parents its my fault and I regretted it

it sucks that physical punishment traumatized me the most and also the bullying
