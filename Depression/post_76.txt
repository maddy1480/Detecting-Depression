Can someone please help me
So yesterday I had to call 911 , felt like I was having a heart attack and was gonna pass out . Doctors said I was fine after checking my vitals and blood work .I was diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression a few years ago. A few days ago they switched my depression meds to cymbalta and idk if it was the switch but I’ve felt like .. out of my body ? Simple things seem so difficult, I can’t fall asleep, when I try I get this weird sensation through my body which wakes me up , I wake up in a pool of sweat and I feel so weak . I just wanna know if anyone has had this same experience cause I’m starting to feel like I’m crazy . I don’t wanna die
