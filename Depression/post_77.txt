I GOT DIAGNOSED
I recently have been seeing a therapist after being referred by a PCP and I got diagnosed with: Depression, General Anxiety disorder, PTSD, Bipolar Disorder, and Schizoid personality disorder.

I am not exactly happy but I feel more whole and able to approach my mental problems with a decent amount of knowledge on them.

If you guys are suffering in the same way I am just know that THERE IS HOPE and you should get a diagnosis if you haven't already.

I am going to get rediagnosed later this month by a psychiatrist, they will also prescribe me medication which means no more drugs :( nevertheless I'm glad to be moving in the right direction

Edit: I was prediagnosed with depression and then actually diagnosed with bipolar, sorry for the misunderstanding
