I've been officially diagnosed with borderline depression and borderline anxiety.
Finally went to a therapist and that's what I've been diagnosed with, preliminary.

I always knew I had it, but I never wanted to address it.

Since I've finally got the courage to talk about my traumas with a therapist, I'm feeling hopeful that I'll get better from here.

Take care.
