Am I experiencing mood swings from depression? Is it something else? Please help.
Hey everyone. So pretty much I have been having mental/emotional problems on and off for years now. I have been diagnosed with anxiety/depression in the past. I have been getting mad at my boyfriend a lot. He doesn’t even do anything either he is amazing. For example if I am telling him something and he responds to it differently than what I wanted to hear I get so mad at him. This results in me being mean to him then after a few minutes or like half an hour I feel intense guilt and then it always ends with me crying a lot at the end of this. This could last an hour or only be a 30 minute thing. I would understand more if I got mad at him for actual reasons but it always me getting mad at him after something he can not control happens or when he doesn’t say what I wanted to hear. I know it is wrong so why do I still keep doing it and feeling it? It’s not normal anger either it’s like intense I could punch a wall right now anger every time. I have also came to the realization that this has happened before with my family and close friends as well but way less frequently. It always feels like I’m going through 4 different emotions in such a short time period. Is this mood swings from my depression? Has anyone experienced this before. If you have please let me know I’m trying to understand what is going on with me. Thank you!
