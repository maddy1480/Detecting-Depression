Just diagnosed
I (16M) just learned that I was diagnosed with major depression today, apparently I've been diagnosed for months but misunderstood when she first told me. It's a relief knowing that I haven't been faking it or 'making a mountain out of a molehill' as it were, but... I really wasn't expecting this. I thought I only had anxiety (learned I was diagnosed with severe GAD today as well), and the major depression felt like it came out of no where. I don't know how to feel. I feel like she (my therapist) made a mistake somehow. Maybe I have a misunderstanding of depression, but I'm still able to get out of bed, shower, brush my teeth, etc. I have good grades, I have friends. I feel happy. I think. I don't remember how I felt or behaved throughout all my childhood, so I'm not sure if this is new or how I've always been. Fuck. I feel like I want to lay in bed all day, learn about dinosaurs, watch cartoons. I don't want to be a real person, existing in the world. Idk, this is just getting my thoughts out there, mostly. I know I don't have really awful depression, but is this real? Is this what depression can feel like?
