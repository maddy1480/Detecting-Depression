why do I always have no energy and want to sleep all the time? don't want to eat either talk to my friends..
I'm 22y. It's been couple months since I've been diagnosed with another depression and the doctor gave me more medication (I was taking prozac for some years, started with bupropion too). I was better, but then I never woke up with the alarms and I had no energy, so he changed my antidepressant from bupropion to effexor. Now the problem is kinda solved, but I literally have zero energy, It's been 2 weeks since I started the new medication and I've missing the university for one entire week. 
Each appointment with doctor is 75€, so I am here asking,  what is wrong? It is because of effexor? Help ༎ຶ⁠‿⁠༎ຶ
P.s: My psycotherapyst thinks I have adhd but one psychiatrist (I only had one appointment with her), told me "I can't diagnose you with that"...?
