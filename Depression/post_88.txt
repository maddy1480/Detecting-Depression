All I want to do is kill time and for life to be over and done with
I’m a 23 year old woman, I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, ADD, dyspraxia and dyscalculia. I’m unemployed and can’t hold down a job, I still live with my parents, all I do is either lay in bed waiting for the day to pass smoking cigarettes, wishing I had enough money to buy drugs and alcohol and sometimes playing mind numbing video games all day, I want it all to be over but I just can’t do that to family, even tho I don’t engage with them. They know I’m depressed but just keep saying it’ll pass and that it’ll get better and that I’ll be better if I get a job but I always quit jobs because I have no self-belief and I feel like others hate me, probably bc I was bullied in school, but I always quit jobs and then beat myself up about it. I think I’m a stupid, jealous, dramatic and selfish narcissist at this point tbh and I can’t get my mind to stop, I think the main problem is probably boredom and my unproductive habits but I don’t have any motivation and don’t get enjoyment out of exercise or watching things, I just want my life to end as soon as possible but since this is not an option I feel so stuck. I’ve tried yoga, meditation, exercise, reading, and other hobbies but nothing seems to make me feel better other than going to a bar and drinking or drugs. I also have no money to even do this, what’s the point
