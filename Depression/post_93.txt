I want to hurt myself, but I don't want to do that while hurting others
I want to kms and I feel like it will make me feel a lot better. but the other day as we were setting up some therapy sessions me and my mom when we were done my mom started to break into tears and told me "do you really want to kill yourself?" and as her voice started to get more and mover wiggly she the said "is that really how you feel sweety?" we both started to hug and I started to sob uncontrollably in her arms. "when I got the news that u were going to be a girl... that was the best day of my life sweety.." I feel so guilty for making her feel that way and I even have a boyfriend currently, so I feel like if I hurt myself I'm going to hurt others around me and the result of that is going to hurt me so much more than now. I want to kms but I'm going to hurt others around me and I don't want to do that yet I still want to kms . I feel like I am being choked like my situation is tied right now I don't how to explain it all that well.
