being annoying is just one of the other things I despise about myself
Mostly my whole math class found me annoying/srs I remember all the weird looks I got from literally everyone, everyone thought I was a chatty,loud,annoying girl, my own friends would call me "extra" and not even in a funny or used it in a good way they called me extra in a way that they were annoyed about I remember the faces they made when telling me. And even my own boyfriend admitted that he used to dislike me at first. Im so annoying I really need to learn how to shut up I hate how annoying I am. I talk way too much and more than half the time I'm just talking to myself I remember this one girl even thought I was a weirdo for it. And English isn't my first language so when I speak I swap words in sentences and even combine words together by accident nothing about me is normal im just a boring annoying freak
