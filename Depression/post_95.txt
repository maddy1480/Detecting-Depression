I'm a loser freak
I hate so so so soo much about myself, all the traits that make me, me just annoy the hell put of me and even my voice and appearance drive me insane and I wish I was just normal like everybody else. Ik saying this Will make me sound like an edgy teen but like I just don't fit in the other day I went on Instagram and saw a kid I knew from school and he was hanging out with a group of friends as far as ik that could never ever be me, that guy is funny and loud but knows how to not be too loud and is loud in a way that makes everyone laugh and makes people think he's just a nice and friendly guy, I'm loud in way that I just don't stop talking I make almost everyone hate me so much. I wish I had friends for the summer I'm an idiot a very stupid idiot freak
