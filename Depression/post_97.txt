My depression feels fake
So I was recently diagnosed with major depressive disorder, and tbh it feels fake. I mean, I do have the following symptoms:

Feelings of sadness, tearfulness, emptiness or hopelessness
Angry outbursts, irritability or frustration, even over small matters
Sleep disturbances, including insomnia or sleeping too much
Tiredness and lack of energy, so even small tasks take extra effort
Reduced appetite and weight loss or increased cravings for food and weight gain
Feelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or self-blame
Trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things
Unexplained physical problems, such as back pain or headaches

But even with all those factors, it just feels like my normal me if that makes sense? Like, its just how I’ve been for so long, so it feels weird for someone to be like “you’ve been depressed this whole time” so like, it isn’t normal to feel this way? I don’t know if anyone else experiences this and it’d be nice if you let me know
