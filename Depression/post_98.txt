I've been diagnosed with depression but I don't feel like taking the meds.
I (31 m) have  been diagnosed with depression and I got a prescription for desvenlafaxine. I'm not that depressed imo, sometimes I go into the hole but it's 100% due to the fact that I studied and work in something I've never liked , on the contrary , it's totally opposite to the things I enjoy or feel interested in. I used to handle it pretty fine ,  but recently I've had too much stress and it has pushed me into a bad place, the thing is  that taking drugs won't solve that , it won't be much of a difference than my friends who smoke weed a lot to enjoy the days. By taking meds I won't be solving the root of the problem, I'll just mask my suffering. My job and career is the only thing I hate about my life, I always have. I have a great and loving family, a magnificent girlfriend, dogs and cats that I adore and I enjoy life most of the time I don't work. The problem Is that I can't ever separate myself from work, I work almost all day so I have no time to enjoy anything, and when I do I am tired. And the other thing is that I am poor, I don't know any other way to make money and I need to pay for my place (more than half of my actual salary)
