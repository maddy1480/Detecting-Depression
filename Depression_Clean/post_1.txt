The   me with  in 30mn, is this normal?
Hello redditors, I would like to have your opinion on my appointment with a . 

I have had an online medical consultation with a  for the first time and his fast diagnostic is throwing me off. We only talked for about half an hour, he asked me about how I feel, what do I think of myself and some questions about my family life. After that he directly said I have , gave me some medicines (lysanxia, deroxat and solian)   and requested another appointment in 3 weeks. 

I feel like he just took the easiest road without even trying to know my personality or any other significant detail of my life, I struggle a lot with relations, boundaries and communication; and he didn't ask to know more. The overall appointment only lasted 40mn.

What do you think of this?
