Loss of libido with no medication. Occasional pain  as psychogenic. Anyone with a similar experience?
A little over a year ago I was  with , which I had been suffering for about a couple months before that, the clearest indicator of something being wrong, to me, was that I went from being a male with rather high libido to losing almost all desire for sex.

The quality of my erections and orgasms decreased substantially (which I guess makes sense in a state of anhedonia, I couldn't enjoy music or exercise either, not enjoying sex surely makes it more difficult, *certainly it wasn't making **it** harder*).

That'd be bad enough, but I've also suffered from "pain of psychological origin" as 4 different doctors to date have described (only one of which performed an examination rather than limiting herself to a verbal exchange, god bless her soul), said pain has appeared exclusively in my testicles, one at a time.

When it comes it's usually at night or it's there by the time I wake up, usually lasts hours and it feels like an intermittent pressure on either testicle, sometimes feint enough it can be ignored, sometimes strong enough to wake me up at night and make me wish I could just get punched once and go back to sleep instead.

Not in look of medical advice but just for context: Can't be testicular torsion (I'd have ended up in ER by now), I'm STD free and always have been (barring false negatives), take no medications and I don't subject my testicles to any treatment beyond caring for them like a bird would take care of his eggs. I'm **this** close to naming them.

The reason for me writing this post: My condition has improved (along with my ), it is not as frequent now, but I can't shake the worry that *something* is actually physically wrong with me. That I am intentionally ignoring something I ought to be caring about, the act of just letting a genital pain be there and trust that it will be fine and there is nothing actually wrong with no proof beyond "it doesn't seem to be *anything* so it's psychological" is one I'd describe as "of pure faith", and it would reassure me to find others with a similar experience.

Any other comment that feels relevant is also welcome. Have a nice day.
