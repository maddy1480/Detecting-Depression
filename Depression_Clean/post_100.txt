intense, mind-boggling mood swings?
hey team. since my latest (and my worst) depressive episode, ive been experiencing horrible mood swings. i'll go from having random bouts of intense anxiety, to feeling suicidal, to feeling empty and numb, to feeling so okay that i can't even believe there's anything clinically wrong with me. it's at a point where i feel like i can no longer trust myself or my feelings, and i don't feel safe in myself. my  told me recently she thinks i have "bpd symptoms" (but won't  me), and i know affective instability is a key part of that. but i can't tell if this is just good ol  mood swings or if it's bpd. anyway, curious to hear if others have experienced anything similar as well with their , and sending love to you all
