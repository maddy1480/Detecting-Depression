I've been  with severe  and moderate social anxiety. I've been dealing with the occasional panic attacks as well. I'm tired. I just want to be normal. I don't want to fight tooth and nail just to exist anymore.
I'm surrounded by people yet I feel so fucking alone. I'm surrounded by hope and love and happiness and all I can think about is blowing my brains out. All I can see are my flaws. Being fat. Being lazy. Being a failure. Being a disappointment. Being alone. Being me. But what I hate the most is my tendency to self sabotage. Like eating junk when on a diet. Or staying up late or procrastinating. Or for example when I attempted to avoid a test by breaking my own arm.

I'm 19, and I've never even had a girlfriend. I've never held hands with a girl or had such a private, intimate relationship with someone that I could not hide behind anything. I know it's all my fault. Knowing this kills me. It frustrates me. I fucking hate it. What's worse is while I'm at work and I'm interacting with people, I've learned to adapt a mask. It helps me to manage to interact with people. I just imagine they aren't talking to me, but a normal functioning person.

It doesn't help when I later have a panic attack and I can't figure out why I can't just adopt this mask and be normal. Why I can't just... Stop being sad. Stop being alone. Stop being desperate. 

I hate myself. I hate what I need to do in order to function everyday. I hope I can one day just be free of it all. I know that it is likely to not happen.

Thanks for reading, whoever's out there. I'm not planning on doing anything (I have lookouts for that kind of thing) but I'm probably going to resume meeting a  in the future.
