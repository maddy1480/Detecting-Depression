I can't function, at all, and it has gotten worse and worse
I'm  with  and anxiety, I'm also on lexapro for OCD. Since four and a half or so years ago, I can hardly do any schoolwork, and have gotten cripplingly behind. All I do is watch youtube basically, and be other social media, literally. mostly youtube though, from 7-8 in the morning to 6-7 at night. I can't do anything. If I'm not on that I'm sleeping all day, just sitting around, or cooking to avoid my work. I can hardly clean either. Both parents are very busy with their school/work and cannot, except for the dishes or sweeping up dog fur. It's made me have panic attacks over me not cleaning. It's not just laziness, it feels like there is 80 pounds sitting on top of me when I think of getting up and working. Then I see the dirty parts of the house and I get so grossed out and cry (it's not that bad even). I do have a semi-normal shower and bedsheet schedule at least. I usually cook for myself or everyone too. I haven't cleaned \[the house\] in 2-3 weeks I can't take it. I relapsed in my self harm after 8 months free of it (and ed, but that's not super important atm), and it's the only thing that keeps me together, somewhat. Please help, what do I do I just want to keep up in school but I can hardly make it through a class without wandering off somewhere else \*coughyoutubecough.\* I just want a clean life and to be normal. I hardly go outside but when I do I feel relieved and just want to stay out. Please I need any advice please what should I do
