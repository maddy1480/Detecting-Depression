Anyone feel less irritated when an advice or action comes from a medical professional as opposed to your own family members? And if so, why?
For context, I am struggling with an eating disorder and so far my weight has been more or less at the healthy range. I realised that I tend to get quite irritated or annoyed with my parents whenever they bought food (snacks, bread, etc) back and tell me it's for me when I didn't even ask them to buy it or say I want it. It makes me feel pressured and that I'm being "forced" to eat those food that they bought. Whereas if my  wants to refer me to see a dietician, I'm actually ok with it even though I don't think it will help in anyway. I don't feel that stress or the feeling of being "forced" to do something.

I'm sorry if this is a weird question or doesn't make any sense. Honestly I'm just trying to figure out why is this happening. I've a perfectly healthy relationship with my family but I've certainly withdrawn quite a fair bit as compared to before due to other mental health issues I'm currently facing.
