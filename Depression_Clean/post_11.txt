I was  with  but I don’t believe it
I’ve recently found a new  after months of searching, because I moved to another city. Yesterday was the first time we talked, and after hearing all I’ve been through and what I’m feeling, she  me with . Though I’m kinda denying it, I’ve done some research and concluded that it’s really true, but I still don’t wanna believe it, so I’m asking people on the internet…

I’ve lost interest in things I used to love, I constantly feel like killing myself, I feel down a lot more, I keep thinking and thinking of things that only hurt myself and bla bla bla…but I don’t feel any difference in my eating habits, neither do my close ones, I also still have happy moments and still feel okay during the day, so that got me wondering…what If I’m just being dramatic and trying to be quirky? If it’s not true at all and I’m just one of those scumbags that fake mental disorders? I keep wondering, even though I have enough symptoms, I feel like a fraud.

Today I feel more irritated than ever, even though I normally feel happy when my family comes to visit me from another city.. I feel moody, I’ve read it’s one of the symptoms of , but what If it’s just puberty and I’m just a rude brat? Please tell me what you think
