Feel worse since 
I was  with severe  (along with mild anxiety and mild stress) two days ago. For so long I have been in an autopilot existence, that I became used to not feeling anything. But now that I know for sure what is going on, I’m sad that I neglected myself for so long. The hollowness runs deep. The pit has permanently lodged itself in my stomach. 

I can’t remember the last time I truly felt excited by something. For so long I’ve been running lies about being excited or happy. What I really meant is that I want to be excited and I want to be happy, but those feelings don’t stir in me at all anymore. I guess the want for it is some sort of hope? 

Tomorrow I start medication that will hopefully help my situation. I am scared about the possible side effects, even though I’m not sure I could possibly feel any worse than this. I just want to feel alive and happy and healthy again.
