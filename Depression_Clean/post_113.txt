“get a job”
I [17F] am severely . For some context, I have been kicked out of 4 different high schools/colleges in the past year due to self harm, poor attendance and anger issues; my  is so bad I rarely get out of bed; my personal hygiene is almost nonexistent; and i rarely go to college because of how bad my mental health is. I have a  of GAD,  and OCD. 

Recently my parents have made it very clear that I’m to get a job to save up to move out as soon as I turn 18, else they’re kicking me out onto the streets. But I can’t get a job. I’m lazy and unmotivated and I have angry outbursts where I just yell at everyone. I have absolutely no desirable traits which an employer would look for and the only thing I’m good for is getting in the way. I have virtually 0 skills which can be applied to the workplace and am constantly ridiculed for my lack of knowledge in almost everything 

I know this has always been inevitable but time seems to be going quicker now and I’m starting to realise how bad my situation is really becoming. I’ve tried meds and therapy but I’m too  to put the work in to get better, so nothing has helped. 

I hate to be one of those people. but I am considering suicide over this. I genuinely cannot see this getting any better.
