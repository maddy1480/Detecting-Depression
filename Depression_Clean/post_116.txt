Accepting  
I was  with  about a week ago. The thing is, I didn't think I was  and I'm still not sure if I really am. 

I can still feel happy and feel genuine emotion and wouldn't describe myself as chronically sad or empty at all. I can still get out of bed and go to work. I don't hate myself either, but I guess I judge myself a lot harsher than other people do unintentionally.

I struggle with self harm and suicidal ideation very often though, and have felt extremely isolated my whole life because of ASD. I don't really have motivation to do things I used to like and I have been having trouble keeping up with hygiene and cleaning up after myself properly.

I guess I could be  but I am just having trouble accepting it since I don't feel empty inside. I've been way worse before and I've known people who have been much worse too so I feel like I'm just really lazy and a borderline hikkikomori and on the path to failure. Maybe I was misdiagnosed, I don't think I'm  but I don't want to rule it out, you know?
