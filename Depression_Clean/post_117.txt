I can't clean my room

I'm NB (18) and I am  with anxiety,  and BPD. It's been months since I've cleaned my room and it's in the worst state it's ever been in. There is no rotting food but there are empty pop cans and bottles along with piles of clothes, some paper and other random junk on the floor. But the worse it gets I feel even more demotivated to do anything so it's like my  is making my  worse. My partner is also living with me but we both deal with similar  which doesn't make it easier.

Any advice on what I can do to clean my room? I'm really embarrassed of it and I'm tired of seeing it in the state that it is in. Obviously cleaning my room is the solution but more specifically how can I motivate myself to finish it or what can I do to make it easier.  I tend to get bored and distracted while cleaning which is another thing that can make it hard for me.

Edit: I forgot to mention there have been days recently where I've missed my medication which may be making my  worse but I'm not sure.
