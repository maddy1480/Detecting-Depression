Q: Should I share my   with my boss?
Hi,

So, I still pick up some shifts. When lockdown is over in my country I am supposed to go back to work more frequently, and I am actually looking forward to do so to have more structure in my life. I'm having difficulty deciding whether to share that I have  with my boss. She's going to ask me how I am which makes me wonder if I should bring it up. I am not sure whether telling her is a good idea. It might be nice to have her know in case something happens which prevents me from coming to work. On the other hand, it feels very personal and almost unprofessional to do so. Any people have some experience with this they would like share?

Thanks for reading and take care.
