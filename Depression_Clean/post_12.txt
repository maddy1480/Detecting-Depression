I had a breakdown
I ended up cutting myself. I thought it was satisfying, and did more when I got mad because I couldn’t cut deep enough, they were all a bit deeper than cat scratches, but not nearly as deep as I wanted it to be. I’m beside my mom and acting normal, but I just feel like screaming, crying and cutting deep into my soul, so I could finally “rest in peace”…just venting, I don’t expect people to pay attention to this, it’s fine, I just wanted to type/write it. I can say whatever I want, no one’s gonna see this, see?
