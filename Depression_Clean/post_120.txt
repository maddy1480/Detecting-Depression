Feeling spacy and blank.. How do I get out of this...
I don't know when this started... I've been doing so well. I've been off medication for a month now, maybe 2 .. I've been freelancing and working my part time job which has been helping me keep some change in my pocket while I establish my myself.

I recently just self published my first comic , and everyone around me is celebratory, and excited. I wanted to be super excited too... But now I'm just feeling super pale and empty about it... I worked all these years for what...

Today I felt SUPER spacy... Forgetful... Started laundry and almost forgot to dry it.. I've started cooking things and would forget I had things in my air fryer.. I'm super spaced out. I got to spend time with my gf after work, but things still don't seem to give me that surge of energy. My memory eludes me and my emotions fly far out of my grasp, and now everything that I do or say feels labored or forced.

How do I fix this...
