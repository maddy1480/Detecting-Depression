My  made false statements in my file
I have been having issues with my  for a bit now, but I needed one last thing from them before I asked for a referral to someone else. In order to register with my university's accessibility services I needed my file, so I requested this. I just received it today.

There are false statements in my file, the worst being that during a phone call with a receptionist I had "become angry and demanded to be discharged from his care." I remember this call. I had expressed my disappointment that a request of mine had not been completed in a timely manner. I never once became angry and certainly never requested to be discharged from his care. But I have been. So now I don't have a .

After receiving a referral I was simply going to leave a negative review. But now with this on top of all the other issues, I will be filing a formal complaint. This process terrifies me, especially knowing that my former  will be reading everything I say and responding to it. Who are they more likely to believe? A mentally ill patient, or the certified professional?

I'm so stressed right now and feel so lost. I'm fucking pissed and distraught. I only hope I can write a clear and factual complaint and that the board or whoever takes it seriously.
