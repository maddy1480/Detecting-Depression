I swear I’m losing my mind
I feel like I’m going crazy. I’m paranoid, I can’t recognize my surroundings properly, and apparently I can hallucinate. 

For a few years now, I’ll get periods where I get insanely paranoid and start almost believing that people or things are coming to get me. It’s honestly terrifying. Just thinking that people will kill me or that an alien is going to get me. It only happens like every few months are the longest the ideas will last is two weeks and then I’m all better. 

I got drunk two weeks ago and the morning after I went home and slept. When I woke up on the Monday (two days after I had been drinking), I couldn’t recognize my surroundings properly. It feels like I’m in a video game and the space is my characters room. Like I’m supposed to know it and it feel familiar but it’s not right. It won’t stop. And it’s getting to a point where people are noticing that I’m off. Sometimes whole hours will go by with me in daze and then I’ll feel myself become more aware of where I actually am. 

And then, on Saturday (night before Halloween), I was having a shower. When I looked to the shower head, there was a shadowy guy standing there. He was on the ground more glitching up and down while hovering. I closed my eyes because it was terrifying and I didn’t know what to do. But when I opened them, he was still there. I knew that he wasn’t real so I thought about continuing showering but all the alarms went off in my head so I left and didnt shower for a little bit after. Now I can’t shower with my eyes open. They have to stay closed always.

I’m just freaking out
