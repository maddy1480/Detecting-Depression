I’m fucked
This  appointment is really going to fuck me over. I’m just trying to know what’s wrong with me. But I’m terrified that he’s going to tell me that nothing is wrong with me. Which sounds like it would be great news, but something feel wrong. And if nothing is wrong then does that mean I just have to feel like this forever? 

I have a   and I know he’s going to reassess me and then tell me I’m fine. He said in an article that if a child is still getting good grades and enjoying time with their friends then it’s unlikely that they’re . Because I’m a minor, he wants my mom present and she’s going to insist that I’m not . And he’s going to take my moms observations over my experience. What if he thinks I’m lying?
