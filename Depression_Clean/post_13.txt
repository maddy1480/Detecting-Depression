I’m miserable and cutting helps
I started today, because of my mental breakdown, and I don’t think I’ll stop doing it. I’m not doing it right now, but I did around 15 cuts or something. I feel hot, my chest feels tight, my heart beats faster and I can almost feel a little smile, it makes me so relieved! I squeeze my arm so I can see more blood, and I keep contemplating it…it distracts me of my emotional pain, and the cuts feel hot rn, but when I cut it it feels cold. I think I’m addicted..! Is it that bad when I feel so much better and relieved? It stings a bit but only sometimes and I put 3 bandaids over them (bc my pajama is white and I don’t wanna leave blood on it).
