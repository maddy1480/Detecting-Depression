It's new to me
I'm new to my  , but I believe I've had symptoms for about a year now. I'm just barely medicated, but sometimes I feel like putting a name to what I'm feeling is so hard. I now know what's wrong, and it's not just teenage angst. It really just sucks. I don't trust many people, and even those I trust to talk to feel like they can't talk to me because I can't seem to pull myself away from the negatives. There is rarely a phone call I have with my parents that doesn't involve a fight. I'm just so tired of everything and can never find the good in what I'm doing or where I am. I feel like when I talk, very few people listen and I get so exhausted with making an effort.  I just really don't know how to handle it all and while I am seeing someone for help, I feel like I can never be as brutally honest as I want to, things are getting bad.
