5 months 0% progresses
I've been clinically  for about 8~ years now and recently (past 5 months) I had become too  to leave my room and am still stuck in this current stage? Or whatever it's called.. 

I've seen multiple doctors talked to a handful of consulars tried differing ssri's and to zero effect and in fact have only had a worse time during these encounters and this past 5 months has tested alot of my relationships and I've mostly been shown the door.

I post because I've become so stagnant that the boredom is pushing more and more intrusive thoughts as if itll be less torture to just do it and get it all over with...


I cant really have a conversation with people as they just think I'm being arrogant or something so it makes things really difficult for me to socialize idk 


What do I even do this sucks and sleeping Just to wake up and wish to sleep again is killing me, wishing I could use this time to atleast do something I'd enjoy would be nice but I domt get the luxury to do them until it's too late and I have get back on track is daunting.

Please help, someone â˜¹

Edit: I'm situation is just getting worse as the time passes I'm starting to burn bridges with almost my entire family and I cant understand why it just feels like prejudice towards me. I'm honestly thinking of cutting all ties as this is exhausting but I have 0 places to go at this point with no one I can rely on, I know this is state of mind is ment to make me feel alone but these relationships I have are honestly hollow and I'm not being dramatic.


I live in new zealand, my mental health has ruined my chances to make anything happen for myself what do I do at this point? I honestly just want to be alone and have time to focus on myself.


For context: I have about 300dollers and almost 0 assists, one friend who's willing to help but he does not know the extent of what helping means and itll kill my only real friendship.
