My  just told me I have mild  and I don’t know how to feel about it
I went for an ADHD . Wasn’t really expecting one, but wanted to quell doubt, and liked the idea of belonging to the ADHDer community. Instead, I got  with mild  and moderate to severe social anxiety.

It makes sense, but also doesn’t, but is also boring and sad.

I considered I might have , but I don’t really feel that sad or low functioning. I just feel like normal ‘adult’ stuff is exhausting and I like to play video games, watch YouTube, solve fun problems and use Discord all the time. I don’t feel sad when I do those things, but admittedly, they are a distraction from this undercurrent of ‘meh’ that seems to permeate my existence and makes doing anything else feel impossible.

I don’t know if this is a common experience for other people on here.
