Alone, but not
I was in grad school from Aug 2019 - March 2020 (covid). I had been planning a leave of absence bc i just wasnt mentally in a good place. Since Aug, I've been  with bipolar disorder, with major  episodes. My 2 manic episodes were stopped dead bc of health reasons both times, i never considered them manic, but my dr does. 

Anyway, I was in grad school, its a fantastic place, wonderful community, great professors, the works. And while i was in a cohort of anout 8 or 10 people, I was the loneliest I have ever felt. I started to doubt my reason for being in grad school. Fast forward to now, im doing a year of service (working with nonprofits) and am questioning my entire life. I felt certain about coming and being part of this new community. But now that I'm here, and have started the 2nd week of orientation, I am beyond confused with myself. 

I constantly annoyed/irritated. Im having trouble remembering to take my pills, and just not wanting to take any of them at all. Ive been in a bad mood for a week. I keep pushing myself to be part of the community, but every time I try i just feel ignored, useless, and not worthy of being there. So, instead of being a party pooper when im around, I've decided to not be around so much, to spare them of my mood and feelings. Ive also been looking of the edge of the balcony a lot. I feel numb, but I also feel hopeless, worthless, inferior, useless, ashamed, afraid. I feel so numb and feelingless, but bc of therapy im able to recognize it isnt numbness, its everything all at once.

This post isn't for anything specific. I just have no friends or family to talk to, bc  i don't have many who really know what I've been going through... i could vent more, but I'll leave that for my journal tonight. This is all.
