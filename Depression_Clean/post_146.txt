Anytime I sit down to do work/study I get panicy/anxious and . Why? How do I fix this?
I have  GAD and . Anytime I muster up the energy to study my body sends signals making me crazy. I feel itchy, like someone is watching me, like I need to run, like I’m in utter danger and I feel so terrible and uncomfortable. Sort of a mental block preventing me from success.


How do I fix this? I can’t go to  due to corona, my meds aren’t working just yet. I can’t man up and rush through this horrid feeling.
