I was  with 
Today I decided to see the  with telemedicine and I told everything I feel and yes I was  with 
I knew myself I am not happy and all the time I made my boyfriend feel down with my expression.
I can't control myself control my emotions and control my crying.
I never thought this is the great way to help myself until yes after I can talk with  she knows what I feel
So if someone who feels like me please believe in treatment it's so important
