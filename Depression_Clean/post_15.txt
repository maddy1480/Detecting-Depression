Personality changes since being 
Last year I was  with clinical . That's when I started noticing changes in my personality. From being painfully introverted, to being extroverted. I used to fear going up to strangers and now it's like second nature to me. I also talk a mile a minute now and people around me started calling me a rapper because of this lmao. Can  or meds cause this? I've been on 20mg of escitalopram for a year as well.
