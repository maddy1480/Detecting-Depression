Question about  fatigue
Posting here for a second time because i am desperate for reassurance or feedback...

I am 23 and have been feeling extremely tired and sick non-stop for a month. I had had so many medical exams- non of which showed anything. So my doctors directed me to a , who said i probably have  and prescribed fluoxetine. I have been taking it for a week and i see no change.
I feel so week and tired and lightheaded all the time like before. Every day it is getting worse. I don't think its from the meds cause i had been feeling it for a month non stop

I just wanna know: can this be ? Like, no lack of motivation but extreme virus-like fatigue (no fever, ever). I almost feel like i want to go and continue my life but my body is so weak that I can't.

I am very afraid that the doctors have missed something, but i have done so many blood tests, ecgs, heart echos, xrays, abdominal ultras. Its all perfect. And i have seen so many doctors they actually tell me to stop.

Please, can someone tell me if they feel like this and it could be  and not some obscure cancer or something.
