They're incomprehensible, illogical and erratic. But these are my thoughts and I want to share them.
Tell me what its like to look in the mirror and hate everything that you see. Tell me how it feels to know that for every second of happiness you are going to have an hour of suffering. What does it feel like to look around yourself, see the people that care for you, but they’re so far away. You scream and yell and cry but they can’t hear you. They’re looking, looking for you. Where did you go? What happened to the happy little boy that lived life to the fullest? Why am I so tired, tired of this world and this life? Every snide remark and ignorant comment feels like a punch to the gut. I’m being eaten alive by a disease whose first mission is to knock out your communications. You can’t tell anyone about the dark cocoon you’re wrapped in. Wave after wave it crashes down on you, you’re drowning, gasping for air. In between the waves you might be lucky enough to see a bit of sunshine, but only for an instant before your sight is robbed from you once more. What is a life without true happiness? Where the best feeling is no feeling at all, and sleep is the only real escape? Can a person really be blamed for wanting to escape such a hopeless place? What is living if it is simply out of guilt for the pain you would cause loved ones? If only I had gotten help sooner.
