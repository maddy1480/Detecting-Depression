Newly 
So I just got  yesterday with  Disorder, I've dealing the signs and symptoms of  since 2021. I got better and now it's back again, so I decided to talk to  since it's getting worse. It's my first time drinking the antidepressants medication yesterday. So I would like to know what are your advice or tips regarding taking anti depressants medications? 

Also, I'm worried about the foods that aren't allowed while taking the meds. I really love foods and I'm scared to eat something that can disrupt the effect of medications to my body. I want to know what are the foods you didn't eat or are not allowed while taking antidepressants meds?
