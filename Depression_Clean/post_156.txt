After 26 years of struggling,  and medicated for  disorder 2 years ago... but it never leaves
I'm a lot more even but it makes the bad  days stand out even more. 

I still have a voice in my head that tells me to give up on myself like everyone else has in my life. Small mistakes are met with "are you stupid?"; questions with "why do you care?"; and (God forbid) new interests with "you're so pathetic you have to live through these actors/characters. Not even meds could fix you!"

This voice wants me to do so much more, and do it so much better. But is constantly sitting on my chest so I can't breathe. And the voice is me, so we're evenly matched.

I can ignore or fight the voice nowadays but it's still there.  It says "I'm protecting you. When you get your hopes up about anything we're fucked over, like every time you show people your emotions and they're used against you. I'm sorry to have to do this but you're stupid enough to let it happen OVER AND OVER. FOR YEARS. And, really, you should be grateful I'm doing this because otherwise, you might think things get better. They don't. Why won't you accept it?"
