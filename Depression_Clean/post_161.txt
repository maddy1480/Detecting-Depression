i was  with  and its making life and relationships worse.
I am  with  at 14 and on zoloft. ive been on it for weeks now and i dont think its helping. i cant help but resent my friends. like, i hate them. i know its probably really selfish of me but they're going to a concert, their having fun, no one texts me, no one checks on me, i dont get asked places, i dont feel real. 

i noticed they stopped wanting me around when they would go to the microwave or vending machine together but always made me go alone. I feel so alone and trapped.

im so tired. i keep wanting to go along with my thoughts and not thimk about the pain with it. even after what happened last time i want more. i want a broken bone or something. something serious and intense. i think hes going to die tonight. im scared. i have no one to go to and cry to and im worried my dog will die tonight. i want to cry. the poor thing is having trouble breathing.

my friends are at a concert and im at home with a dying dog that needs help eating his favorite bone. im so scared and feel so alone. i have no one, no escape. i wish i was dead, or in the hospital. i want to feel that care and worry that i only get when im hurt. maybe thats why my thoughts keep getting worse, the worse they are the better chances of the hospital and the more attention i get. 

i dont know what to do or how to handle these feelings. i cant eat or clean my room because i feel like a slob when i eat due to stress and i hate my room so i dont clean it because i hate how it looks. school, home, family, and even friends are a nightmare. i feel awful.
