Day 7 of antidepressants
I (21 f) didn’t really think that it would have that much of an effect on me. But my sister said that I’m a lot nicer, I interact more, I go out of my room, and I don’t have my usual bitchy face anymore. I do feel a lot calmer and I feel like I speak a lot softer as well. This is only day 7, I hope to see the other positive side effects as well. 

Also! I willingly went out with my sister today! And I was the one who invited her to go out! (Something a rarely do)
