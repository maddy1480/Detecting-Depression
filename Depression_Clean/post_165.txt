My (21F) mind feels foggy with the antidepressants...
It's my 8th day of taking antidepressants and I feel a lot calmer and my sister said I'm a lot nicer as well. However, I feel like my mind is so foggy... as if I can't think very clearly. Is that normal? does this go away? I like that I'm calmer and that the people around me can see a change but I don't want my mind to be stuck like this forever...

The meds I'm taking are Vortioxetine (Trintellix) and Brexpiprazole (Rexulti).
