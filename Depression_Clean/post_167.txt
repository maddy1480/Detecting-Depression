One of the guys that did something to me is at the same College.
I have no idea what to do, I can't really stand up for myself. When I've resisted to people before they have just gotten really violent.  
He's seen me, he's waved to me. The next time I saw him, I sped-walked away.  
I've sorta shut down and I feel tense, as in my muscles are all tense, and I keep looking over my shoulder. I didn't think he'd be back. I just feel really numb, but I have a feeling this isn't going to do me any good.  
I know he has some sort of learning disabilty, so he might not even understand even if someone tried to explain it to him.  
 I don't really have any friends that I could hang around with, but I could just go up in the LRC for my lunch, I don't eat lunch anyway, and music helps me loads. 
This is just me getting my thoughts into order, they are a bit racy at the moment. And I know my sleeping is going to get worse now.
