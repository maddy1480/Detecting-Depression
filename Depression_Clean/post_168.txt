My boyfriend said to me that surely that my PTSD wouldn't be bad if I was over what had happened, and I do see his point, it does make sense.
He knows I won't talk about my feelings, he knows stuff that has happened to me, he also knows I use humor to cope.  
Not gonna lie, I make pedophile/rape jokes and all sorts of dark jokes, but really only in front of him because he has a dark sense of humor to, but he's said that mine is quite a bit darker, and I joke about things he wouldn't touch.  
He said that these things that have happened to me must bother me if I'm like this, and I do really see his point, and I'm not sure if he's right or not.  
He said I act like it's no big deal, it's normal (it kinda is for stuff like this to happen to me), but he knows me extremely well and that he can tell that it does bother me a bit.  
I'm not sure if it does it not. It's just something that has happened, I can't really change it.
