My nightmares are getting so much worse, and I don't know how to cope
For the past week my nightmares have gotten so much worse. I've only been sleeping for 3-4 hours a night which isn't normal for me. I had to go away on Residential for 4 nights, which triggered this. But since I've came home my nightmares have been the same, stopping me from going to sleep because I've been too scared to, so I've been staying up at like 3-4 in the morning to completey exhaust me, but I always wake up around 7-8 to get ready for my course which starts at 9:30 and carries on till 4. The lack of sleep is really catching up on me. It's making me all shivery with headaches and I'm constantly tired and snappy. I don't know how much longer I can handle this
