Does clinical  have to happen for a reason?
I'm  with clinical .
However, whenever someone asks me why I'm , I don't have an answer to give him.
I didn't gain it from like a loss of a loved one, relationship breakup, terrible home situation, or anything like that.
I don't think there is a specific reason why I have it. It's probably because of loneliness and alienation. But sometimes I feel like it is maybe not all becaude of that.
sometimes even when I'm at my lowest low at a certain day, nothing particularly saddening or depressing happened to me on that day.
I'm just severly  from the beginning of the day, and it continuely gets worse as more hours pass, even if nothing bad happened to me that day.
And I can't state a reason for my .
When people ask me why, I can't give them a reason:
"Oh it happened because of this and that".
I'm not saying my life is great, not at all, but there is no specific reason I think I can give people as to why I'm . I would say more that there are a lot of factors and things that contribute to it.
So what I'm wondering, is it common with clinical ?
Is it common that you can't put a finger on why you have it? Or is it just me?
I've seen on the internet that if you don't have a reason, it can happen from inheritance. But I'm not aware of whether someone in my family had  sometime. I know my parents never had to say the least. So it's not from inheritance.

So, is it normal?
Does clinical  have to happen because of a specific reason or inheritance?
Or can it just accure for no specific reason?
