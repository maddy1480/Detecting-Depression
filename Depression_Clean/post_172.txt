Got 
A few days ago I went to my family  and he  me with sever  and anxiety. I knew I was in this state for years prior but I only spoke up recently. Now I will be seeking professional help like  and perhaps ever take medication. I just feel so hopless, scared and lost about the future and it's distroy me not only mental but is also harming me physically.

I wish I could just sleep the rest of my life away.
