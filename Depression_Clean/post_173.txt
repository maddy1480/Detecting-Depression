So scared of the future going badly
I don't know how much more I can take it. Every single day all I do all day long is think about the various ways I could ruin my life and or how someone else could ruin my life. I can't stay focused in school or work and often find myself day dreaming about an awful future.

I dont know how much more I can take of this. The fear of ruining my life is tremendous. I imagine how bad things could happen for everything I do or plan to do. The fear is so immense and I feel that panic you get when you get hurt or humiliated when you mess up as if it's happening now.

The only time I'm not in this state of mind is when I'm asleep. Anyone else going through something similar?
