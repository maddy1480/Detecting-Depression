too lazy and unmotivated to try anything
I don’t feel like trying to make things better. In fact, I never did. I just accepted it as a part of life. It may be because I’ve never been that much of a person that works hard. I’m just lazy in general. I like to take things easy. If you’re lazy, apathetic and unmotivated, there’s pretty much no chance of overcoming .
