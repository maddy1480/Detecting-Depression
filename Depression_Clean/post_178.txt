No title for this one
I don’t want to get bullied anymore. A few times, I told myself I would stand up to the demons but I never did. I’m just weak and defenseless. Everyday I’m sleepy, despite me doing nothing. I’m supposed to be in school today, but now I’m skipping school and isolating myself from everyone to make sure no one hurts me.
