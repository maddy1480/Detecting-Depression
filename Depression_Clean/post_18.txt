should I tell my parents that I'm ?
I'm 17. So I obviously still live with my parents.
I've been having  for almost a year now, and never told them.
My mom really really suspects something, more than my father, and she is constantly asking me if I'm alright(which really annoys me to be honest) and always makes observations of suspicion, like for example how she told asked me today if I'm alright, and said I don't even look at her in the eyes.
I personally don't think I ever want to tell my parents that I have . My parents being my parents, will react in ways and act in ways that I really don't wanna go through. Not only that, I just don't think I can bare to tell them from a personal level. As I haven't really told anyone besides maybe 1 person, that I have .
Me not telling my parents have some bad affects, like my father reacting very harsh on some things that I do which are causes of symptoms(which he doesn't know about, nor does he know they are symptoms of ), and my mother being "worried sick" and continuously asks me to do things I don't want to or can do(like go out of my room and spend time with them).
Is it better to tell them?
Should I just step up and do it?
Because I really don't want to tell them, but there are bad disadvantages to not telling them, and I think eventually they will understand on their own one day(they already did, but I denied it).
But also, if I did tell them, that would follow up with a massive change in behavior from my parents towards me, which I really don't want to, because it's just gonna make me feel so much more alienated and ill.
All I really want is for them to never discuss anything about it, treat me the same way as always, and not bash me for things like symptoms which they are not aware of.
I just want this to be away from their life and knowledge, but apparently that can't happen.
