Not anxious, not sad but tired and unmotivated as fuck ! Anyone ?
Last November 2020 I had to stop working, I was  with burnout/.

I refused to take medication until march 2021. In march 2021 I started Lexapro until June. My psych then switched me to Effexor because I was complaining of intense fatigue.

Effexor was hell with side effects, I got worse but also because my gf broke up at that time ! So in August 2021 I started Prozac 20mg. Prozac seems to have helped with my anxiety, I feel much calmer. But I have no motivation. Or I would say I have motivation, psychologically I want to do things but can't stop procrastinating and lay in my bed watching Netflix. It's stronger than me ! 

So 2 weeks ago he added 150mg of Wellbutrin to help with energy and motivation. But I feel even more tired, I have eye rings (they never disappeared since last year) I can say I sleep better as I don't wake up during the night anymore but I still wake up tired after 10 hours of sleep ! 

Is it normal ? Is it residual symptoms from  (psychologically I fell in a much better place) or side effects of medication ? 

Even if I feel better, I'm still not functional. I don't feel energised enough to look for a new job but it has been 1 year already. I can't stay like that forever. I am a young (28yo) graduated guy. I want to live my life but it seems the only thing I can do now is staying in my bed and procrastinate. I used to be the guy waking up at 5 am to go to the gym...

Do you think I should switch meds ? Or do I have bipolar or ADHD or smthg else that explains why I don't fully recover ? Or do I just need time ? 

Sorry for the long potatoe.
