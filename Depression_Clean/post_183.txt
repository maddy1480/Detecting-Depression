Help ! Will she come back ? :(
To keep a long story short :

August 2020 : I met a girl who had a long distance relationship. We kept dating because we like each other.

November 2020 : I was  with burnout/

December 2020 : she breaks up with her long distance relationship.

February 2021: we tried to have sex but I had sexual dysfunction due to my burnout. She told me she was "turned off" because of it. She started to became distant and told me it was for other reasons than sexual dysfunction. I kept reaching to her because I was totally addict.

June 2021 : we kept dating during all this time. after months of arguments (me asking her why she was acting distant) she broke up with me and tells me she was dating a new guy since 3 weeks ago.

2 days ago I unfollowed her on social medias to help myself moving on. She wasn't watching my stories anymore anyway. I begged her to stay with me for a month. The day after I unfollowed her she unfollowed all my friends and asked her sister to unfollow me too. 

Why did she did this ? How did her noticed so rapidly that I unfollowed her ? Was she still looking at my account ?

Do I have any chance to win her back after all this ? 

Thanks !
