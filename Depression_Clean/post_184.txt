I've burned out a year ago. How to know when to return to work ? Will I fully recover one day ?
Hi everybody. 

1 year agor in december 2020, I was  with burnout. I tried 4-5 antidepressants to discover 2 months ago that I had sleep apnea and that could be causing my symptoms. I am sleeping with a CPAP since 3 weeks. Even if I feel way better than a year ago, I am still unemployed.

I mean, I am able to go out with my friends, do some freelance work (I am a 28yo architect), read about, watch a movie, sleep 8 hours. (I couldn't do those things during months !)

BUT I don't feel I am thriving like before. It is like I wasn't 100% recovered and I don't know why.. Even if I sleep 8-9 hours I feel less energized than before (could be sleep apnea), I don't feel as sharp mentally as before (could also be sleep apnea) and I don't have this fire in my soul pushing me to do things ! 

I am still taking 10mg of prozac/ day which is a very low dose for my big body and my psych wants me to stop as he says I am not  anymore. I can agree with him as I don't have those anxious feelings as before and I am able to be social again etc.. but not at 100%

Is it normal ? Do I need more time ? I would like to have some advice from you guys !
