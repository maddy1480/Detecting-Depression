Nothing excites me anymore
I believe this is just a phase and everyone goes through this, I just don’t know what to do. I have no energy to do my hobbies, I hate my job. Even traveling, my most favorite thing to do also doesn’t seem fun. I just want to vent in, do nothing yet the feeling I’m not doing anything productive stressed me out, like I’m just wasting my time. Will this feeling ever go. Wtf is this feeling?! 😮‍💨

Anyone has a tips and tricks? A guidance of what to do with life?
