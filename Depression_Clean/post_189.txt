Got  with severe  today - I almost had a blackout
Hey there,

today I went to a  for a therapy consultation. I really didn't want to have a breakdown but I did. Its very hard to speak about the truth. I cry very rarely but I just couldnt hold it and now I feel ashamed. The  told me its no problem still its hard to deal with the fact that i got that emotional in front of a stranger person. She  me with severe  and I got the strong recommendation to make a stationary therapy at the hospital. Something I really dont want to do. Half of everything I didn't even hear cause I was so in shock - even tho I knew I had the  coming. I for example dont know anymore what I did say to her about the question regarding Suicide thoughts or many of her other questions. Maybe I exaggerated? Even though I am a understater I am doubting my cognitive abilities now. I dont know what I did say. It really hits different hearing it from an expert. Now I really dont know what to do. A stationary Therapy would completely shatter my life. My few friends dont know my mental state and I dont want to tell them. My parents know and support me.

I want to overcome this disease cause every aspect in my life is suffering. But it is very hard for me to accept that I maybe really need stationary therapy. Are there any tips to deal with this situation. At the moment it just feels like a feaver dream and I couldn't eat very much cause I feel like I am about to throw up.
