I may be developing paranoia
In my family there is someone with paranoia, so I might be exposed to this disease, by DNA.

I used to do online activism, in particular using VK, controlled by the Russian government. After a couple of days, all of my devices connected to the internet were compromised, in particular my phone was hard resetted, my computer got a virus extorting me money to recover my files and so on. I am not the only one who experienced something similar.

Since that incident, I am being developing some paranoia. It started by better securing the devices and the network, but now I am scared for my own health. I know it is irrational: no one is gonna come to kill me for some activism, but can't help myself.

What can I do? I am ashamed to talk about that to my .
