I'm a failure I'm a failure
I'm a failure at everything I do I'm failing at life and I don't know how to get out this loop! Please please please help me I'm feeling I'm slowly and inexorably dying inside. I'll write here a non complete list of the things that make me feel like this:

• Studies are going very bad
• Job doesn't allow me to pay bills
• Family hates me (really)
• Physical problems that give me so much anxiety because I can't treat them, I can't heal and I'm ashamed of them
• I don't know whether I'm in love with my pure hearted girlfriend
• I'm lonely, few friends and with social skills issues (I've often been confident but lately I'm closing myself in my shell). I'm wasting my youth

Honestly I'm doing all I can but it's not enough. I want to start life again!!!
