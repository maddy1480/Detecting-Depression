I do not feel any emotions, only anxiety and pain.
Lately I was on a railway line and when a train honked, thinking "I should get away from here" was not my priority, I moved only because a friend said "move out!". I was not scared at all.

Another similar episode happened just today: while driving on an highway I was very close to hitting a car which suddenly stopped, doing a dangerous maneuver to avoid it. Again, I felt nothing even if I was so close to get seriously injured.

But I feel anxiety: I feel anxiety for my future, for my relationships, for my career. I can also get emotionally hurt when something hurtful happens, but that's it. I don't feel anything else.

What can I do?
