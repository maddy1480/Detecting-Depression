I don't know if I am living as a dissociated person
If so, I've never lived like a nornal person because been experiencing this for years.

I often have time recognition difficulties, like today I thought September was yet to come, or feeling a whole month pass so fast.

I used to often forget what I did the past days (not anymore tbh).

I say something, then the next day someone tells me "why did you say _____?" And I don't remember saying so neither I recognize myself in those words.

I'm often irritable.

I am scared.
