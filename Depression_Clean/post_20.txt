do people with /major  ever have days where they don't feel /down or that their mood is stable?
During let's say a single week, do people  with  ever have a stable mood/non  mood, where they don't feel happy obviously, but don't particularly have a down/ mood?
Like simply a stable or ordinary mood, I'm not saying happy, or manic or anything, but just an ordinary/stable/non  mood?
Do they have days like that during a given single week?
And if they do, how many days of a week? 3 days? 2? 1?
Or is their mood  or sad all the time or almost all the time?
Does it rule out to be  with , if you have stable/non  mood, for about 3 or 2 days of a single week?
Or do people with  are almost all the time severely  or just ?
Can you be  with  even if you have stable mood days for like 2 or 3 times a week?

PS - if you are not a /, and you are  with , please let me know the status of your mood in about a week time.
How many days of the week do you feel ? And how many of those days are severe  mood?
