I was  with  some time ago but have been putting off recognizing it. 27M
I have ignored my symptoms since high school. Even after the few 'attempts' I have made I convince myself that it's just a normal rough patch. 

It wasn't until 26 that I finally put myself through therapy and tried taking medication. I have learned that the medication they give you so willingly has life lasting mental instability downsides. I decided to get off of them a few months ago due to this and I feel awful most of the time again. 

I am finally past the withdrawal stage that they don't warn you about well enough. Now I keep getting creeping thoughts of ending my life a couple times a week. Every time I start getting these thoughts I start having an anxiety attack and can't sit still like there is a fire in my brain. Fight or flight. I have tried everything from meditation to staying fit to opening up to friends about my situation but nothing seems to fully help. I am worried that I may hit a major low again and end my life one day. I don't want to die but sometimes I can't trust myself when my mind shifts into a darker place. 

I have finally come to terms with my  and I have recognized it as a mental illness like any other disease. I have a great support circle who understands my situation and who takes me seriously when I say I feel like ending it. 

I thought I would post my situation here in hopes that someone else who has struggled similarly could offer more advice on how not to feel this way anymore. Or, at least, to a lesser degree.
