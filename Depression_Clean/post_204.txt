When I was a junior in high school, I used my yearbook to make a list of the people who’d come to my funeral if I died. If I spoke to a professional at the time, would I have been  with ?
Like many, many others, I experienced issues with mental illness during my years in high school. Always having a sense of FOMO, always feeling like no one cared or understood, asking friends if they’d prefer if they died before or after their parents, and sometimes feeling that the world was crumbling around me. One night, during my junior year (age 16), I thought it’d be a good idea to break out the yearbook and write a list of people I thought would come to my funeral if I died. Would I have been  as ? I know everyone experiences those feelings differently and I know my story here is pretty tame when compared to how others carry out self harm or process trauma, but if anyone out there feels down, please know it gets better. I still have those thoughts from time to time, but the professional help I’ve sought and the perspective I’ve gained with age make it easier to stay present.
