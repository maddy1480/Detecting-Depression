College freshman, I just got  with  and therapy is unavailable. I'm not sure what to do.
I'm new to Reddit as a whole so forgive me if I've gone about this wrong. I graduated high school this last May and after that I've started feeling a bit more down than usual. Up until this point, I've really never had to deal with anything remotely similar to . Now that I'm in college, it almost feels like I'm drowning in these thoughts and it hurts like hell. Any time that I'm alone it just all hits at once and I can't think about anything else. The workload isn't the issue, nor is my schedule. It's more like a lack of purpose and support. At this point, I'm really just unsure of how to proceed.

I guess it's mainly because:

1)  I feel more lonely and isolated than ever before; I've always been extremely extroverted so this hits particularly hard. My family also lives hundreds of miles away and I don't really have any friends in my hometown.

2)  I don't think I'm really where I'm supposed to be. I go to a small college in the South and would rather be in a service academy (a pipe dream as a child where more of my current hobbies and interests are) or somewhere with more people to meet and interact with (likely a more elite, and generally bigger school).

3)  Therapy, due to financial and logistical issues, is largely unavailable to me. I don't have any clear sources of help.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks y'all :)
