Almost 2.5 years since i was  with  disorder
‘Friends’ used me, some close friends left when i ‘had my future plan set’ and they didn’t, friends left me because of their boyfriend, my relationship didn’t work out , I couldn’t/can’t speak to my friends freely, I can’t concentrate I can’t sleep at night , my mental illness was made fun of in front of all my friends by one person, my overthinking kills me from the inside everyday , i tried taking too many pills at one point of time, my  randomly left me w/o saying anything and without my test results, my doctors didn’t pick up my calls when i needed a prescription to get medication during lockdown , financial stress , my 2 best friends turned their backs on me , my relationship involved more people than I could’ve ever imagined , i have trouble talking about my emotions even to my childhood friends , it’s been almost a year since I’ve cried out , I’ve been told ‘be strong, you’re a man, get out of it’ ‘start working out , you’ll be fine’ too many times . Last year , my friend who was going through way too many things , died by suicide even though she was one of the most positive people I’ve come across. I’ve had to go through all of it alone and whenever i opened up , it backfired. Let’s hope opening up on reddit doesn’t backfire too, am i right? 
I just want to tell everyone reading this that I’m proud of you . I know it’s been tough and I can’t guarantee that it’ll get better , but I’m still proud to see what each human can go through all alone and still put a smile on their face in front of others!
