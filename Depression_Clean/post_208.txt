UGH
I barely like going out with my friends because it feels so superficial with one group.
Another group of the 3 of us. Well, they will literally talk on the group and have a normal conversation and ignore my texts blindly. 
My school friends, they’re getting busy and we haven’t been meeting and chilling and having fun the last month and they’re going to leave next year and i dont want that.
I had the worst breakup every 2 years ago but since then I haven’t found any girl attractive or had a hookup. I still have feelings for my ex even after whatever happened.
I’m entering my final year if med school and it’s haunting.
I lost my friend to mental illness a year ago and people have been acting so normal as if it meant nothing. Wonder what would happen if i pass away too.
I was  with  2.5 years ago and then my  said that i might have bipolarity, hypersensitivity disorder, anger management issues and other stuff but he couldn’t  because my  just left without saying anything and took my test results with her . And my  couldn’t even pick up my calls to write me up a prescription at the start of lockdown.
So , for the past 2 years, I’ve been almost all by myself and I’m getting really tired. I’ve not cried in the past year and i have bottled things up to the brim. It’s a matter of time before i explode.
