One whole year ;
It’s been a year since i lost my friend to suicide. She was this really pretty really positive girl who had gone through so much that nobody deserved. She always told me to stay positive. I had only known her for 3 months. We didn’t talk much during my exams last year and she didn’t reply to one of my chats so I thought her exams also started. But after a few days my friend told me what had happened and he said that he didn’t tell me before because he knew how my mental state was. I still haven’t been able to believe it completely. It’s hard for me because somewhere, after losing her, i feel i lost my battle too with mental illness. 
I truly hope she is in a happy place now . Rest in peace S. i will always miss you and never going to forget you. You have been too strong for way too long. You can relax now queen.
