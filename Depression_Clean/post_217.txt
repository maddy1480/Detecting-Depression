If you can't live for yourself, live for others
I'm a hypocrite as I still plan to end my life nearly every day. I've been contemplating suicide seriously since childhood, and come to some realizations.

- if you can't experience joy in any situation, stop trying and instead focus on giving and bringing joy to others before your life ends

- you could have everything, a loving spouse, good friends, money, physical health, and it won't matter in the slightest.

- when you die, if people remember a good person they are brought to grief remembering that person constantly. If you can convince people you're not worth it, then you spare their feelings and your death won't have a lasting impact on them.

- I won't ever forgive myself for anything I do or justify, but I forgive even the worst people that have negatively impacted my life. Not necessarily because of helping myself to cope, but that everyone is fighting some battle and personally my lord and savior wants me to forgive regardless, as I myself am not free of sin either.

- when you die, neither your money nor possessions come with you. Learn to detach from material wants and live the way which leaves the lowest footprint.

- everyone is a hypocrite, myself included. But that's ok, because it means they have the potential to learn for the better.

- we live in a manufactured world, while I don't believe in many conspiracy theories since they lack substantial proof, it's not hard to see what we have is a media-centric dystopia. Disinformation pushed for capital gains with little regard to those impacted. People infighting with their neighbors instead of educating and being the change they want to see. People more interested in being right than being correct.

Maybe these are just the words of a mentally impacted, soon to be dead person, and I don't assume everything I say to be fact or correct. These are my observations from decades of seeing life through our lens.
