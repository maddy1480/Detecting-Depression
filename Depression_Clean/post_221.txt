does anyone else do this?
Man I'm over this addiction... once again started binging the heavy stuff after going a whole month sober. Once again, the other night I sent abusive texts but this time it was to a girl I was seeing. We slept together, had good chemistry etc and for whatever reason, in my smacked out mind I went nuts. She ended up blocking me on everything.

I really don't understand it. I've done this to so many people. Voice calls, texts, emails.. to family and friends. Like I just get psychotic. Does anybody else do this bullshit?
