You ever wonder if your  is wrong?
I’ve been  with  by two different doctors, but they would do their consults so quickly I think they could be wrong.
I don’t feel like hurting myself, I don’t feel like killing myself (even though I think about how I would do it), I just can’t do things.
Looking of how it is for other people I wonder if I haven’t been misdiagnosed, and be just lazy.
