did a presentation in front of my whole class and for the first time in my life my anxiety was somewhat under control!
I've struggled with social anxiety as long as I can remember. I'd get *so* sweaty and would turn beet red and start shaking trying to do presentations. Or just start crying in the middle lmao. I was put on a high dose of Zoloft after I admitted to a treatment center over the summer, and idk how much it's helped with my  but I feel likes it's helped with my SAD. I don't have to take prn before presentations or whatnot, the Zoloft is even to control my anxiety and keep the physical symptoms under control. It does come with some side effects though so I guess you just have to find the right dose. 

But I did the presentation for my Spanish class yesterday and it wasn't that bad! I kinda stumbled and had a brain fart but at least I didn't turn into a tomato. And I'm worried my partner hates me because I am not a great presenter but whatever.. Not bad for a presentation in another language! My Spanish teacher said I did good so hopefully I get a good score (but ofc I'm anxious about my score....) bc I don't wanna retake. 

Just felt like sharing :)
