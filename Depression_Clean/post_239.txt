i feel like hurting myself but i’m too scared to do it.
today has been a bad day so far, worse than usual. i got  with severe clinical  about a week ago and have had a hard time trying to cope with it. i often fantasize about getting seriously injured just to see how many people would care. i just think about all the people i know that have their entire life figured out and are incredibly ambitious and here i am with almost no skills i’m remarkably good at (besides writing and cooking). also going through a breakup so that hasn’t been much of a help either. the only things keeping me afloat at the moment are my dog and sublime’s debut album 40oz to freedom. i know there’s hope and i know i can get out of this but i’ve been feeling like a massive dumpster fire lately. i hope you guys are having at least a decent day and i wish you the best.
