Regular, everyday household chores just seem to be so overwhelming
I find every little chore bothersome. Maybe I’m just lazy but I think I just loathe any kind of manual labour. Hell I haven’t even unpacked everything in our new place since moving in mid July. And there’s still stuff in storage that we need to move over and unpack. It doesn’t help that I feel like I’m doing this all by myself. I am responsible for basically all of the cooking (the only manual labour I somewhat enjoy), 90% of the cleaning, 90% of laundry, 70% taking care of the dog and most of the unpacking. I keep getting pressured by my in-laws to hurry up and move the stuff we have stored in their place in space they don’t use. I just feel all the pressure and it’s too much and none of it gets done and I fail in one of the most basic requirements to be a functioning human. I’m sure if I just had enough money I could just pay someone else to do it and thus, like most of my problems, more money is the answer
