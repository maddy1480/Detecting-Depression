I keep wanting to leave my family
Very often when I get really , especially when it comes with the realization of what a pathetic failure and loser I am, I tend to want to leave my family behind so I will no longer burden them. Especially when I see evidence that they might be able to manage without me. If I did that they would be free to live their lives and I could just go die in a ditch somewhere.
