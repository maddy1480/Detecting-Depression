Do any of you ever feel like the loser sibling?
My sister has always been the smart one in school, and we’re both in college but I do it online. My sister always gets good grades and I don’t, she makes it look easy while I’m over here struggling to do the simplest of assignments. 

My sister has been in college for one year and she’s been given scholarships and has been offered a tutoring job at her college. Life is going well for her, and I’m on taking a break from college to focus on my mental health. I’m so jealous of my sister. I wish I had the confidence and the knowledge that she has, but I’m just a nobody.
