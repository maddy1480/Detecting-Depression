if you want to cure your  listen to what my mom has to say!!!!
“happiness is a choice” 
“you’re dirty room causes your anxiety and ”
“you’re  because you don’t go outside enough”
"everyone feels  and anxious”
“you just need to pray”
“if you work out you’ll be better”
WHY DOES SHE THINK SHE IS AN EXPERT ON EVERYTHING WHEN SHE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT IT L, ESPECIALLY MENTAL ILLNESS. SHE DOESNT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT ANXIETY OR  OR ANY MENTAL ILLNESS BUT SHE LOVES TO ACT LIKE SHE DOES. SHE DOESNT EVEN REALIZE THAT THEY ARE MENTAL ILLNESSES WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT SYMPTOMS, THEY ARE NOT EMOTIONS. IM SO DONE WITH HER AND HER NOT EVEN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT  AND ANXIETY IS
