*PLEASE HELP* Need some opinions on validity of  vs. character flaw
Hey all, I need some help. I've been wrestling with a question for so long and idk if I'll ever come to a comfortable conclusion. While I have been  with  by mental health professionals, I have a hard time really accepting the , I mean it is just a serious of questions (I could technically lie) and it was done via zoom each time anyway. 

This was all in August/September because my anxiety had reached a point where things were starting feel not real and I couldn't feel comfortable or focus ever. With my colleges classes being online, I moved in with my parents to slow things down, continue classes from there, take medication, continue therapy, etc. I only planned on being home for a few weeks before I felt some assistance from the medication and I could start piecing my life back together once everything felt manageable....that was 5-6 weeks ago now. No help from medication or therapy, in fact I'm feeling much worse. 

My father and mother have been suspicious that this is all in my head. They understand that my mind can be quite powerful in making me believe things so they think this is just a case of facing my fears and making it work. I had a very similar situation to this a few years ago in which I transferred universities because "things didn't feel right" and I began to panic. My parents worry this is just that same cycle. They think of it as a character flaw instead of a mental illness. And I sometimes have to agree. Although, they have still been sympathetic. 

Throughout all of this, my  just wants me to accept this as anxiety and  and believe there is some kind of chemical imbalance. But me and my family have a hard time doing that. 

What are your thoughts?

TLDR:  or character flaw? Am I a classic over thinker  or do I have a chemical imbalance?
