*Need some help please* Is there a chance I'm just emotionally weak?
I'm strugglnig.

I understand  is something totally different. I've been  with . I just worry that I don't actually have it. like maybe I've slipped through the cracks. I feel like I'm just avoiding reality. My  doesn't feel like what I thought  would feel like. I just feel so disconnected from myself and everyone around me. I just feel like I'm in some alternate space of the universe. 

I've been put in therapy and antidepressants and nothing is helping me. It's making me feel worse actually. Because it allows me to avoid the reality that put me in . If I've been  with clinical , is there a chance they're wrong? I don't have much hope in getting better.
