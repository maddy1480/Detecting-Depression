I've been distinguished in a well-known bet enterprise in Spain due to my mental illness
The company is ONCE (National Organization of Blind People <Spanish translation>).

I attended one medical interview and the interaction started as follows:

Interviewer: "**Well, as a matter of fact, I see very complicated to hire you, because you have TWO HANDICAPS compared with other candidates to sell the lottery voucher on the street**.

**One side you have one  disability , and in the other hand you have a mental illness as well**"  (my  is  unspecified psychotic disorder ).

Me: *But I am not less than others, I have worked my whole life as a waiter and commercial selling things successfully, despite my *.

I stated in another post that I don't have symptom's such as hallucinations, delusions, I haven't ever heard voices, and so on, but the interviewer didn't care about my speech

He hardly pay attention to my CV or my words when I say him that "I can work equal to another  physical disability/intelectual disability person", he ignored me, he treated me like a retarded person and with  prejudiced beforehand.

**My conclusion**: Avoid these kind of companies to work in if possible. And it is better to hide in your CV that you have been  with a mental illness. We can't fight against the stigma.

Postscript: It is worth to say I won't ever buy the voucher/coupon of blind people any longer.
