all i’ve done is ruin myself
i’m never going to be loved, after years and years of razor blades to my skin my own boyfriend can’t look at me to have sex. dark purple puffy lines all across my skin, with an eating disorder im either showing ribs, throwing up and breaking the blood vessels in my face, or im binge eating and gaining rolls of fat back. i stay up nightly and have eye bags, cry all the time so my eyes are bloodshot. i’m too  to take care of myself or the environment around me. my self hatred and desire for suicide has made me numb and non affectionate. all i want to do is isolate myself with my self harming comforts. i don’t know how i got to this point, but it’s been like this since i was 12. 21 now and no hope for the future that i’ll recover from my mental illnesses, i’ve tried medication but it made me not care about anything. it made me not care about my eating habits so i gained weight, hating myself even more i stopped taking it. i just wish i could disappear without hurting anyone
