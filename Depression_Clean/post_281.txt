doubting 
After 2 yrs of internal debate I finally went to my gp and I took the test and he  me w  on the severe end of the spectrum and prescribed meds. i guess it finally gives me a label which I guess kind of like and means it’s fixable and isn’t just an inherent part of being human which would very much suck. however part of me has been nagging at myself for the past couple of days and I can’t help but to think I might’ve over estimated how bad I have it, or my answers on the test were skewed by idk particularly bad vibes on that day and it’s just been rlly bothering me. I feel like subconsciously I’m just somehow faking it for attention and I hate that even more, even tho there’s no one to give me attention lmao, just needed to get this off my chest sorry
