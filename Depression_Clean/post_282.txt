side effects of antidepressants (fluoxetine)
I’ve been on fluoxetine for abt 7 wks now, and not being able to cry is fucking me up in a weird kind of way. I can still recognise that I’m pretty much dysfunctional in the way in which I’m going abt my schoolwork and stuff but I’m so used to being able to cry abt it to experience some emotional relief and now it’s frustrating to still think negative thoughts and not being able to feel sad abt it if that makes sense at all? like I’ll stink think inside “holy shit u fuckwit why can’t u do this” but I just feel numb and it’s unnerving. I just want to curl up into a ball and cry rn but I feel like I physically can’t. anyone else get this?
