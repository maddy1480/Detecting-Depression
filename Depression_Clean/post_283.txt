Everything in the world seems bland and i don't feel happy anymore
A few years ago i was  with severe . I've tried to commit suicide on two separate occasions, although thats now in the past. I don't want to die anymore but, i just don't feel happy anymore. I stopped my meds and i cant go to therapy rn because im in university. I stopped my meds because they werent doing anything.


I have friends who care, i think. They say theyre supportive but i just can't get myself to believe them. I feel so alone and tired. Tired of having to wake up and talk to people. Tired of the loneliness. Tired of feeling like no one cares. I try to make my life better, by being "positive". But there's only so much i can fake. I don't get any joy from my hobbies anymore either. I really am at my wits end. How can i get rid of this feeling?
