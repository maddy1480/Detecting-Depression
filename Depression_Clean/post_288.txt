How to get rid of these thoughts??
I've been  severly  2 years ago. I'm only 20. Since then I've tried 5 different medication, tried with none. No changes. I'm seeing a  for the pas few months.

I still get those. Can't get it out of my head. This hand of mine holding a gun to my head. This need to injure myself to be taken seriously. The fact I can't and don't want to kill myself doesn't I don't think about it all day. Because of that I'm not "urgent".

I used to get in VR to be able to visually kms.

I got people yet I feel so alone. I'm tired of all this. Seems like there's no way out.
