everyday feels like it’s my last
how the fuck am i supposed to see light when i’m at rock bottom. all i do is rot, like seriously my brain has gone to absolute shit. i can’t even remember a single thing anymore. everyday i just wish i would finally do it, i’ve had this plan for like two years now. there’s this beautiful spot in the woods maybe 2 miles out off the highway. it’s so quiet sitting with the trees. it’s like when i’m out there i stop thinking. i’ve been getting into xanax lately, taking more than i can handle is what’s getting me through the days. i just want to cry, and become covered in moss.
