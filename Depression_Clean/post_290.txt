With mental illness  on the rise, why is there a lack of quality counselors and such low salaries?
I guess this is sort of a r/explainlikeimfive post, but since I've been  about two years ago with , I've found that there is a lack of available, decent counselors, at least in my area. I considered meeting with one at my university to have my dosage changed only to find that the wait period was a month and a half at least. I raise this question because I'm now thinking about meeting with my original  who's usually available and not very helpful. He's like 80 and it's really hard to explain to him things like social media apps and how kids today are completely different. I know he means well, but I feel like I'm just wasting money if my mental state is not improving.  

Why are counselors/psychiatrists seemingly always overbooked? Why is there an over saturation of psych majors but mental illness is only increasing? Any feedback would be great even if you just wanna talk about your experiences with shitty .
