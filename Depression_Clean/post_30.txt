i was  with  a couple months ago, was taking 150 mg of zoloft. long story short i still want to kill myself. doc said i have rebound  so typical anti depressants might not work for me like they do with others. asked if bipolar runs in the family and has me take a survey. now i’m  with depressive bipolar. i don’t like the feeling of knowing that i may have that. as if i’m stuck like this forever. i’m taking vralar 3 mg now. i still feel like i don’t belong here and it feels extremely discouraging
