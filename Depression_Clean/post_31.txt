dying in my dreams
i think the countless times i’ve died in my dreams has made me crave death even more, either suicide or someone else’s doing it always has the same feeling in the end. it’s like warmth in your brain and no where else. you can still hear but can’t see or think, the only sensation is that warm feeling in your head. finally rid of all the thoughts you have on a daily basis, on a less depressing note i’ve been clean from self harm for a little over a month. after a 10+ year battle with it since i was around 11 years old.
