I got  with severe . After a 6 month wait, I got a . Guys, how or when do you know therapy is working?
I got  with moderate  a year ago, and then with severe  a few months ago. I requested a  in january, and finally got one in september. We've had 7 sessions so far, but how do I know it helps? It doesn't feel like it helps? When do I get better? 

I will add, that it seems like my  relies mostly in the "and how does that make you feel?" -method. But I have no issues with recognizing what I'm feeling, nor do I have issues with talking about stuff. I need to understand WHY I feel, and think the way I do. 

So guys, how long did you go to therapy before you felt like it helped?
