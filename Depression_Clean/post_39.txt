I hate the phrase "It's all in your head" or "It's just a phase"
Just being told that makes me feel furious because those who say that act like  will simply go away immediately or after a short period of time.  doesn't go away, it sticks with you regardless of if you want to accept/deal with it or not. Who are you to say that it's that when you yourself have never felt what a person with  has? 

Towards the end of last month I made the mistake (I shouldn't have never said anything) of telling my former co-worker that I was  with mild  which then resulted in him telling me "It's all in your head and you don't need therapy", he also told me that I'm normal several times. But he also told me if I feel like I need therapy then go right ahead and that if I feel sad just listen to music. Another former co-worker said that I'm normal as well and that I'm beautiful and talented (which made me cringe, I suck at accepting compliments). 

 I've tried listening to music when I feel down but that doesn't always work. Whenever I go through an episode, "it's" still there regardless of what I do :/. 

(I'm just a bit angry right now sorry)
