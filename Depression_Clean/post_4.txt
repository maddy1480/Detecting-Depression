Can a depressive episode worsening OCD symptoms?
So, I am  with both OCD and  Disorder. I seemed o have both under somewhat control, but I have fallen back into a depressive episode overe the past 2-3 months. With that recently my intrusive thoughts and compulsions have gotten worse too. I haven't struggled with contamination obsessions in years and all of a sudden I can't stop worrying about it. As well as suicidal obsessions too. I don't know if it's just me but I have suicidal ideation AND suicidal obsessions. I've had an increase in both of these. I don't know if anything I said is relatable or if it makes sense, but I want to know if it's common for this to happen? Specifically having ocd symptoms worsen after falling into a depressive episode. 
Hope someone could answer this for me.
