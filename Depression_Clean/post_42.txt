Something that stuck to me about my .
To understand, this is my first , before that I was in coaching, but that didn't help, partly because I didn't really get along with the person.
Since seeing a real  who actually does stuff, I'm feeling to be in better hands.

I really like my , he is kind, friendly, and he listens when I talk about my issues. He was the one who  me with social phobia and moderate depressive episode. I've been in therapy since April.

The last time I saw him, I told him that I want to see a . (I already spoke to my GP about my issues and she recommended a  and we started medication with my consent (but only for my sleeping problems). My  found a  to be a waste of time & effort because he would only prescribe the medication my GP would already prescribe, plus the  would only have heavy artillery for me.

Now the things that stuck with me:
1. "It's a phase."
It wasn't until I thought about it that I realized how strange that is. He always tells me that all this, what I'm having, is a phase to autonomy. Independence of my parents and the start of my adult life, like getting a job, moving out. It sounds to me like he would think that as soons as i'm independet, my issues will disappear.
2. "It's not psychiatric."
He said that in a sub-clause when I told him that I had been prescribed medication by my GP. I don't think he's really pro-medication in my case, but the  would be responsible for something like that. While he may think I can do it without medication, I got to the point where alcohol was the only solution. I am firmly convinced that medication for these mental illnesses makes more sense than drinking alcohol.

Those two things are always running through my mind now and I don't know how to think about them.

What do you think? Am I just paranoid and overthinking or I'm right to worry? Do I need to look for another ?

TLDR: My  said things that stuck with me till now, and I cannot stop thinking about them.
