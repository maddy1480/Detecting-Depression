Told my  about my suicidal thoughts


Here is how the therapy session went:

First I told him about my suicidal thoughts. In fact, I felt very uncomfortable about it. I'll explain it just for the sake of simplicity, from my point of view.

I have thoughts about rather being dead than alive since middle school, probably because of bullying. On Sundays I was always afraid of the coming Monday. Since last year or the year before last, these thoughts have been plaguing me more intensely and are probably more to blame for self-hatred and a lack of a good future.
The thoughts revolve around being dead rather than alive, I imagine suddenly falling ill with a fatal illness, being run over or dying in my sleep. Sometimes I also look for potential methods of suicide, but I won't go into that further.
As far as I can tell, I would never do it just because of my parents.

I'm confused by myself at the thoughts of self-harm. Actually, I have a general fear of sharp objects (such as syringes). And yet months ago I started trying to realize my thoughts, which I'm sorry about.


When I had suicidal thoughts, he said they were passive and normal. I'm not crazy or anything. He sees self-injury as a way to get rid of stress through pain. A healthier method would be through a punching bag or spiked stress ball.

To be honest it was very good to talk about. I've talked to almost no one about these things. When it came to self-harm, I felt uncomfortable myself. My head is trying to tell me I'm only doing it to look pathetic and get attention.

So yeah that was the appointment.
