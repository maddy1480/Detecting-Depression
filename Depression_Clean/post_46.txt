I only see problems
I'm sitting here and can't motivate myself to do anything.
Everywhere I see problems and I can't enjoy anything because of this.
"I have to be productive", my mind tells me, but what even is productiveness? It's subjective. What's in it for me even if I do something productive if it is unproductive in the eyes of others?

I see my hobby as something productive, my parents don't i guess, after all, i don't earn any money with it, so it's unnecessary, a pure leisure activity. Hence I do it for myself and only for myself, but then it's even sadder when  kicks in and takes away my motivation and passion in my hobby.

Besides this there are so many other things I see as problems:
- clothing (try new aesthetics, where to buy)
- cosmetics (hair care and facial care)
- job search (manageable with social anxiety disorder)
- (mental) health care
- fitness (nutrition & workout)
- university (what about next semester)

And this is only the tip of the iceberg. It's like i'm going to get insane sooner or later because I just can't handle the stress. I know i can't achieve perfectness, but I can't even get an okay that. satisfies me.

Do you have any advice?
