Multiple subjects in 1: group home, kitten, and trying to afford hygein supplies/clothes
I have a few question because this seems to be the best place for me to go when I need advice. I am going to be going to a group home for youth soon because my home isn't super stable. I'm concerned about my kitten. She is 7 months old and she is my world. I will be gone for a year and a half. I wory that she will forget who I am when I come back and she won't even want to be around me. She currently cuddles with me every night. I'm gonna miss her. 
Will she still remember me when I come back? And how do I get her to remember me? Would getting a stuffed animal or something with my scent on it help her?

My second question is about clothes and hygiene stuff. I have like 1 pair of pants that actually fit and 1 thing of shorts. And Idk about shirts I might have like 3. They all got incredibly dirty because we had bugs from traveling (we are in the process of getting rid of them) I don't want to take the clothes I have to the group home because I'm paranoid of infesting the place. And I barely have any fitting clothes to begin with. I also don't have really any hygiene supplies (toothbrush, toothpaste, face wash, shampoo, conditioner, bodywash) my family doesn't have money to buy me a few pairs of clothing. I don't know how to save up money myself or how to figure out how to get clothes. How do I earn money to buy clothes and hygiene supplies? I feel terrible starting a gofundme because I'm not sick or dying. I don't know what to do. I really need new clothes and hygiene stuff. Especially because I'm going to a group home and will need stuff to wear and take care of my self with.
Any advice? Please help with suggestions if you're able to.
