A serious question for who are  with PDD (Dysthymia)
I have been  with dysthymia recently. I thought I had autism or schizoid personality disorder all the time until I visited a very experienced . He saw me three times until he came to the conclusion that I was suffering from dysthymia.

So, I got married five months ago. I didn't have any honeymoon phase and still don't feel anything toward anyone.

This is what makes me worried. Otherwise, I don't have any problem with this in a world full of suffering. Dysthymia makes me immune to all kinds of emotions, so negative emotions don't affect me at all.

However, I will have a kid soon, and I want to treat my condition before he arrives in this world. I want to feel that amazing moment and give him all the love I can and don't want my condition to be a barrier between my family.

If anything has worked for you, please tell me in a comment. It can be medicine or anything else.
