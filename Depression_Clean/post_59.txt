Emotional detachment
For the last three years, I’ve experienced emotional detachment. It’s been so long that I forgot I have it. I have close to no emotional reactions to anything external. The only way I can make myself cry is if I’m pretending to be sad. I don’t feel anything and it makes me think I’m crazy. I don’t act numb because I fake my emotions. Even when I’m alone. I used to feel more. But now when situations occur when emotions would most likely come out, it doesn’t even feel like it’s happening to me. I could chop off all my hair and I would have no reaction. My sister got engaged and I had to fake my reaction. Whenever I hear news, it’s just like hearing words and that’s all. It doesn’t feel like I’m emotionless per se, it feels like I’m not even processing the situation in the first place. Logically, I know it’s happening but I don’t feel aware at all. Why is this? Is this ? Am I a sociopath? I’d also like to bring up that I have been  with OCD. And I had a very emotionally abusive father at a very young age.
