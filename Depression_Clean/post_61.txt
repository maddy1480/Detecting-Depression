I would be dead without my meds and it makes me mad when people say otherwise
Seriously I know  meds are heavely debated and how taking meds it's up to one's choice  but damn I'm tired of my dad and my mother in law telling me that I should stop taking them. They told me it's a lie I tell to myself when I say I'm still alive thanks to my meds. But I know how I prepared my suicide, how I still contemplate it most of the days and how I almost slipped two times this month. I know how bad my life was without meds and how it is a least bearable now. But really I was at my limit. 

I know that meds are just a temporary relief. I think they're here to help me staying alive to adjust my spirits and mentality. To find ways to cope. But to do that I need my fucking meds, and they keep questioning that. I'm glad I'm living soon because I'm tired of this. What I do is between me and my therapists and not up to anyone to discuss.

Sorry for complaining, I just needed to get this one out
