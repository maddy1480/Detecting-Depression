My mother in law doesn't understand that I don't want to start a 20h/week internship during my last year of master degree
I know she's right : getting this internship is the best option for my curriculum. But I already had an internship in this place in April and it led me to the psych ward. I have to finish my memoir and I have a part time job so I don't need the money. She says I should stop pitying myself and get myself to work. I'm struggling with suicidal thoughts. I struggle to wake up everyday. In September I had to quit a job because I wanted to kill myself too badly. So I just want to take some time for my mental health, even if it means I get a bad cv... I don't care, I just want to finish my time in uni alive. But she tells me I should try harder and fight so I feel like shit. She just acts like I could snap out of my  in a few days and think I should stop taking my meds. I like my father but honestly I don't even feel like visiting him anymore.
