Death as a subject has become my escape
Since my  began, I've been more and more interested in death. At first it was only with the inevitability of my own death and how I would kill myself, but it quickly became more general. I've started to read a few things about foreign practices in ethnology, works about thanatology, etc. It's a bit weird but it feels like I've found a safe way to explore death. I'm still afraid of dying (even if I have suicidal ideation) but I hope it'll help me come to terms with my own mortality. And I'm learning things, which is good. I'm glad to see I can read again.
