Is it me or my boyfriend?
So I've been thinking. I've been feeling really low these days and I've been thinking if it's me or my bf who's impacted my emotions. Because he's been telling me his problems in his life and I want to listen to them because I can't do anything and help him but instead i seem to say negative things to him and he says I'm not supportive. But the thing is I can't bare to hear the things he has to say because I feel like it takes a toll on my mental health.
Then there's this feeling that it's just me and maybe I am not supporting him. I have my own problems to face and i can't take it anymore. I've just been crying everyday. I wake up feeling like shit.
I been telling my bf that we shouldn't be together. We've been dating for 5 years now or more idk. Do you think he's the problem?
