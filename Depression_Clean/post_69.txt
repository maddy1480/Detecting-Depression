Finding no reason to live.
I thought I was feeling better after having a confrontation with my family about my  but lately I've been feeling low and really demotivated to do anything. I don't see any reason why I'm here. So I'm 28/f and my family wants me to start a family and get a kid. But I don't want one and I don't see any plan of having one in the future. I don't have a job and don't want one, so I've been doing business in baking and getting orders from my usual customers. And there are days that I don't even wanna do that too. I don't know what to do. I'm just stuck.
