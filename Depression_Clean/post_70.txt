Am I  or just lazy?
So I'm 28/f have no stable job just a bakery business that I can stop any time. I try to be active by going to the gym but thats it. Wake up, eat, crochet a bit, gym, eat, sleep, repeat. Lately, I've been feeling super low and find no reason to live. Been feeling this way for years but now it's time for me to be an adult and help around the house but I don't want to. I'm tired all day and just surviving. I see no future ahead of me and it's really demotivating. ðŸ˜ž
