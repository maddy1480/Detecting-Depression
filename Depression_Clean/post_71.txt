no motivation at all
Its been a week or two but I havent combed my hair yet and fix myself. Its a struggle everyday. I often not brushed my teeth yet. I don't know if its  or just laziness I am having. I was already  with  and bipolar 2. Its hard because I have to force myself to take a bath or comb my hair just to be presentable to other people. I just wanna seek help again and go back to my  or find a . My mom always say that "you are already 20 and you are still like that, not washing face, brushing teeth, and taking a bath." Its just an achievement when I do those things because I always lay down in bed like its my life there.
