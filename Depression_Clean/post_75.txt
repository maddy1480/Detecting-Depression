I finally got  two days ago, starting on meds, and it's been a rough week
Hi, guys. I honestly don't know who else to tell this to. My friends, while they are strong on mental health advocacies, they just don't seem to be the person I could open up to, considering how close I am with most of them. I feel like what I do need now is talking to professionals, not friends... or people who feel the same way as I do. I don't know how to explain it... it's just different. Maybe that's why support groups exist or work.

If anything, I've been in denial that I do have . I didn't want to admit I have it. Even though it's pretty obvious. My  literally said I got checkmarks on all of them. I could Google it on my own and basically see it for myself (thanks, doc, lol).

Anyway, the side effects have been terrible. First day was nausea, imbalance, mental fog. Now, it's just the mental fog and tiredness. I heard it's going to be a bad first week or two weeks, but I'm hoping I can hold out for long...

Anyone wanna talk about anything? This or something else? I've been on the bed most of the day since I really do feel tired. I try sleeping, but sometimes I can, sometimes not.
