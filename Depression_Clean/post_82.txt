Cancer 
Long time lurker, first time posting. Please be nice. 

So I got  with breast cancer when I was 23; had to have all the treatment. Surgery, chemo, radio and hormone treatment. I put on a shit ton of weight from the steroids and stuff and never managed to loose it. They told me 5 years for the hormone stuff but at the end of the 5 years they said they would extend it to 10. I decided against that as the menopause, hot flushes, pain, worsening anxiety and  was too much so they have started me on tamoxifen which tbh I find to be just as bad. Either that or I feel like I hit a point where I realised this is my life now. I think I might have been delusional up until this point, thinking time would make me go back to normal and everything would be ok but then one day February I realised it never will. I’ve really struggled these past 7 years and now I feel there’s no point. I left my job last year because I just couldn’t do it anymore, my mind has slowed down and I’m just so unreliable as 3-4 out of 7 days a week I feel terrible. I’ve spoke to my oncologist,  etc but there’s not much they can really do for me apart from alter treatment etc. I feel like shit for even complaining about the treatment cus I know people have it way worse than me and they don’t even get a chance. I don’t really do anything anymore, I just sit in the house and do laundry and look after my cat and husband and I am just barely managing that. I struggle to talk to anyone in my life about it so now I’m turning to strangers on the internet lol. I don’t even know if this will get seen or if anyone will even comment but at least I tried. I don’t even know if I’m looking for advice or help or just someone who understands.
