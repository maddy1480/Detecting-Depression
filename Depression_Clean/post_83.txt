Recently 
Hey all, 
I’m new here and recently I was  with  among other things. I don’t know what to do. I see a  weekly but I want to avoid medication if I can. My life just turned upside down in the matter of a week, I’ve known that I have felt empty or off for the better part of 4 years now but seeing my  on paper is so hard. I don’t know what to do.
