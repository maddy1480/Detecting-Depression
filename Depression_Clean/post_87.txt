Constant passive thoughts of non-existence?
So I've recently been  with severe , which was kind of surprising to me. I knew I had some form of  but kind of brushed it off as not that big of a deal. But I started going to therapy and I was told that it's not actually "normal" to constantly have passive thoughts of.... just not existing?

I don't want to do anything drastic, no plans or anything. I don't even really think about death exactly. It's just that I'll sometimes think it would be nice to not exist, like *poof* and then I wouldn't have to deal with rent, taxes, work, etc. But apparently having these kinds of thoughts nearly everyday means I have severe .

Is this really something that's rare for others? I always kind of figured that everyone got these thoughts but apparently not?
