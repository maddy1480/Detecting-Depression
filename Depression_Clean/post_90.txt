[HELP] I don't know what I have!
Before I went to the  for the first time, I had problems maintaining eye contact even with close people. I would feel like crying and start shaking. My  1  me with  Disorder and Anxiety Disorder. He gave me 60 mg of lexapro escitalopram. I started taking it and was able to maintain eye contact with people, and no longer felt like crying. My  2 said that I just needed therapy, that I didn't need to take medication. My  3 said I had schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Currently I don't know who to believe. Could it be that  1 was right? With lexapro escitalopram I was able to look into people's eyes, without the urge to cry. When I took it off, I had the same symptoms again.
