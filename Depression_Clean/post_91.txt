an event that still drives me insane
Around the last day of school in May, I was in homeroom and a friend of mine brought the classroom picture of when I was in 3rd grade I kindly asked her if I can cover my face with a sharpie and she said sure even she did the same with her face that was also in the picture. And then she hands the picture to some other kids, and one of the kids with I'm guessing his finger he was able to rub off the sharpie and revealed my face and to which he responded with "EEEEEWWWW" very very very loudly and I got mad and threw something at him and even slapped him and to this fucking day I still think of how much...I HATE MY FUCKING SELF SO MUCH IM AND IDIOT IDIOT IDIOT IDOT EVERY ONE AND I MEAN EVERY KID AROUND THAT SMALL TABLE WHO WAS LOOKING AT THE THIRD GRADE PICTURE LOOKED STRAIGHT AT ME AND WAS SHOCKED THEY ALL THOUGHT OF ME AS A DUMBASS FREAK I AM A FREAK IM SO SO SO SOOOO STUPID AND WHATS EVEN WORSE MY BF WHO WAS NEXT TO HIM EVEN HE GAVE ME AÂ  BAD LOOK!!!! AND BEFORE I EVEN HURT THAT KID MY BF DIDNT EVEN SAY ANYTHING, HE THINKS IM A FREAK ASWELL AND ONLY FEW PEOPLE ARE ON MY SIDE. IM SO SO SO SOOO DUMB, everytime I have someone talk about me in a bad way I always keep my mouth shut and just decide to laugh it out and often I just apologize that it bothers them that much and everytime I tell this to people they always tell me "Allison u should definitely say something back or do something about it" and i always denied this because i was scared of embarrassing myself. AND THE ONE VERY TIME I DO STAND UP FOR MYSELF I JUST EMBARRASS MYSELF IMMEDIATELY I'M A FREAK I'M AN IDIOT FREAK! if I sound crazy mad at myself but I am not I just hate myself so much and wish I was just normal and could've just kept my mouth shut like I always do (ik that probably no one's gonna even read this but whatever I needed to get this out I wish I had longer sessions with a  so that i can talk about stuff like this im do stupid)
