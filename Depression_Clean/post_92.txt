I can't find any real friends in my life
My bf is my only real friend but my current friends literally treat me like meg they even joke about it themselves I seriously want to find new friends but I can't find anyone with the same interests as me and I hate it, why can't I find any good friends? The only reason I'm still holding onto those friends is cause they sometimes make me super happy and cause they're the only people from school I hang out with after school. When can good things happen to me socially, I'm so stupid and awkward and I hate how no one is into my sense of humor or interests and the people that do I feel super awkward with cause we're both socially awkward. I wish I was a boy sometimes so that my current friends could maybe like me more. I want to be a different person and I hate how I'm always happy with them but they most of the time treat me bad why can't I have happiness and good friends once in a while? I want to be happy in my life where do I start if hardly any one likes me and the people that do I can't reach out to them. No one is even gonna see this, but please I hate how my life is turning out my mom isn't even supportive she just yelled at me for being an idiot and having friends like them. I want to end it but my bf is the only thing from stopping me, so I want to heal but I can't even if my life is just constantly hating me. I hate how Idc what eat. I hate how I'm not pretty to anyone but my bf. I hate how everyone thinks my loudness is obnoxious and weird. I hate how I always feel like a constant nobody. I hate everything about myself. I hate whenever I'm slightly happy I feel body dysmorphic again. I hate having . I hate my low self esteem
